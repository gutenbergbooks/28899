<p>The present volume, which covers the period 1683&ndash;90, is mainly
devoted to an account of the controversy between Archbishop Pardo and
the religious orders on one side, and the secular government on the
other&mdash;a conflict of which such events as the disputes between
Salazar and Dasmari&ntilde;as (1591) and Guerrero and Corcuera
(1635&ndash;36) were but preliminary skirmishes. In this case the
archbishop gains the ascendency, being re&euml;nforced by one of the
governors.</p>

<p>Dampier&rsquo;s account of his sojourn in the islands is here
concluded from the preceding volume. He finds the Mindanaos friendly to
the English, but distrustful of the Dutch and Spaniards. They are
ingenious and clever in metal-work, and with very primitive tools and
appliances make excellent utensils and ship-repairs; another industry
of theirs is shipbuilding. The English ship remains about a week on the
southern shore of Mindanao, to wait for favorable weather, and then
proceeds to the Rio Grande of Mindanao, where it arrives July 18. The
natives there are anxious to secure trade with the English merchants,
and Dampier regrets that his companions did not resolve to give up
freebooting for Spice-Island trade, especially as they were so <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>well fitted,
by experience and training, for establishing a trading-post, and had an
excellent equipment for that purpose. The English officers maintain
friendly intercourse with the natives, which enables them to see much
of Malay life and customs. Some of the English sailors desert here,
some are poisoned by the natives, and most of the crew become drunken
and disaffected. The captain neglects to discipline them, and finally
the crew sail away with their ship and leave him (January 14, 1687),
with thirty-six of his men, at Mindanao. They halt at Guimar&aacute;s
Island to &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; their ship and lay in water; then
(February 10) sail northward past Panay. At Mindoro they encounter some
Indians, from whom they gain information as to the commerce of Manila,
which they intend to attack and pillage. On February 23, the English
begin their piratical acts in the Philippines by capturing a Spanish
bark, near the coast of Luz&oacute;n. After describing that island, he
relates how some of the English sailors left at Mindanao find their way
to Manila. The men on Dampier&rsquo;s vessel, not finding the Chinese
vessels that they expected to seize, decide to wait on the coast of
Cambodia and Siam until the time when the Acapulco galleon is expected.
Having cruised along the mainland until July 29, they direct their
course to the Batanes Islands, north of Luz&oacute;n, arriving there
August 6; they trade with the natives, clean the ship, and lay in
provisions, intending to go afterward to harry the Manila commerce. But
a fierce storm arises (September 25), driving them about for a week,
and disheartening the men; and finally (October 3) they sail from the
northern end of Luz&oacute;n past the eastern coast of that island and
Leyte, until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11">11</a>]</span>they reach Sarangani, where they halt to repair
their ship. Departing thence November 2, they go to Australia, and
Dampier soon afterward leaves the ship&mdash;spending the next four
years in the Malasian Islands, and, after numerous and varied
adventures, arriving in England in September, 1691.</p>

<p>Francisco de Villalva, procurator for the Dominicans at Madrid,
petitions for royal aid in sending forty missionaries of that order to
the Philippines.</p>

<p>Some unknown Jesuit furnishes a &ldquo;diary of events from June,
1686 to June, 1687.&rdquo; These include the arrivals and departures of
ships from the port of Cavite; the deaths of prominent persons; the
dissensions between the Jesuits and the archbishop, and between the
religious orders; the conflicts between governor and Audiencia, and
their relations with the archbishop; attacks by pirates; and other
news-items, of miscellaneous character. A similar record (whether by
the same hand is uncertain) continues through 1688.</p>

<p>A notable event in the history of the islands was the controversy
(1681&ndash;89) between Archbishop Pardo and the secular authorities.
Hundreds of documents and printed books are extant concerning this
dispute, but our limited space will not allow us to reproduce many of
these; it seems most useful for our purpose to give an outline of the
main events during that time, as told by some of those who took part
therein, both secular and religious, and representing different sides
of the controversy. These contemporary documents are re&euml;nforced
with abundant citations from the chroniclers of the religious
orders&mdash;the Augustinian Diaz, the Jesuit Murillo Velarde, the
Dominican Salazar, and the Recollect <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>Concepci&oacute;n; these are found in
the annotations accompanying our text. The first account is that
written by Juan S&aacute;nchez, secretary of the Audiencia, dated June
15, 1683; he relates the difficulties which arose between the secular
and the religious authorities during the three years preceding that
date&mdash;that controversy having begun in 1680, with the complaint of
the cura of Vigan against the acting head of the diocese of Nueva
Segovia, that the latter does not reside at the seat of that bishopric,
and interferes with the above cura. The Audiencia undertakes to settle
the affair, and the archbishop insists that it belongs to his
jurisdiction. His cathedral chapter are offended at certain proceedings
of his, and jealous of the influence acquired over him by Fray Raimundo
Berart, a friar of the Dominican order (to which Pardo also belongs).
The new bishop of Nueva Segovia also claims that the Vigan case belongs
to his jurisdiction, not the archbishop&rsquo;s. Several other cases
occur in which Pardo acts in an arbitrary manner, among them his
seizure of a shipment of goods for the Jesuits, and his excommunication
of a Jesuit for declining to render him an accounting in a certain
executorship entrusted to the latter&mdash;Ortega alleging that this
affair, as purely secular, pertains to the Audiencia alone. The
Audiencia endeavor to restrain Pardo, but in vain; and the strained
relations between them quickly grow into open hostilities. The
situation is complicated by various antagonistic elements, which may be
briefly summarized thus: The archbishop&rsquo;s arbitrary conduct
toward his own clerics and other persons, and his strenuous insistence
on his ecclesiastical prerogatives; the undue influence over him
obtained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13">13</a>]</span>by his Dominican brethren; the jealousies between
the various religious orders; and, still more fundamental, the
unceasing conflict between ecclesiastical and secular
authority&mdash;the latter embodied mainly in the Audiencia, as the
governors often ranged themselves against that tribunal, under the
pressure of ecclesiastical influence. To these may be added the
remoteness of the colony from Spain, and its smallness, which renders
the limits within which these human forces are at work more narrow and
circumscribed, and therefore intensifies their action. After a long
conflict between Pardo and the Audiencia, in which their weapons are
used freely on both sides&mdash;decrees, appeals, protests, censures,
and legal technicalities of every sort, civil and canonical&mdash;that
tribunal decides (October 1, 1682) to banish the archbishop, a sentence
which is not executed until May 1, 1683. He is then seized by the
officials of the Audiencia, and deported to Lingay&eacute;n, a village
in Cagay&aacute;n. His assistant bishop, Barrientos, demands the right
to act in Pardo&rsquo;s place; but his claim is set aside in favor of
the cathedral chapter, or cabildo&mdash;which declares the see vacant
in consequence of Pardo&rsquo;s exile. Another Dominican, Francisco de
Villalba, is banished to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a for seditious preaching;
and others are sent to Cagay&aacute;n.</p>

<p>The narration of events in Manila is continued in another document,
from July, 1684, to June, 1685; this account is unsigned, but it
suggests the hand of the preceding writer, S&aacute;nchez. On August 24
of the former year occurs the formal entrance into the city of the new
governor, Curuzelaegui. This change of administration gives opportunity
for the return of the banished Dominicans, and an agitation for the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14">14</a>]</span>restoration of Pardo to his see, which is quickly
accomplished. Soon he lays an iron hand on all persons who had formerly
opposed him. Excommunications are imposed on ex-governor Vargas, the
auditors, and other persons concerned in the archbishop&rsquo;s
banishment; and the members of the cathedral chapter are suspended, and
their official acts during his absence are annulled. They are not
absolved until near the end of Lent (1685), and this is done in public,
and very harshly, with great humiliation to the penitents. At the
urgent remonstrances and entreaties of Curuzelaegui, Pardo finally
consents to absolve the ex-governor, Vargas; but he loads this
concession with conditions so grievous and humiliating that Vargas is
unwilling to accept them.</p>

<p>Another unsigned document relates the &ldquo;occurrences during the
government of Cruzalaegui,&rdquo; of which a part, relating to the
Pardo controversy only, is placed here with others on that subject; it
covers only the first year, 1684&ndash;85. This writer also sympathizes
with the auditors; his account is given mainly as an index of popular
feeling on one side of the controversy. A letter from Auditor Bolivar
to his agent at Madrid (June 15, 1685) presents an interesting view of
the affair from the inside, and of the intrigues which kept Manila in a
ferment during most of Pardo&rsquo;s term of office. Bolivar dares not
write to the Council of the Indias, lest his letters be seized; he
therefore directs his agent to take certain measures in his behalf,
&ldquo;for one cannot trust in friars.&rdquo; He recounts the
proceedings in the residencia of Vargas, in which there are many false
witnesses. He thinks that the Spaniards of Manila are more fickle than
any others, and regards that colony <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>as &ldquo;a little edition of hell.&rdquo;
He is eager to get away from the islands, and urges his friend to
secure for him permission to do so, and to make arrangements so that he
may not be needlessly detained in the islands. A letter from the Jesuit
Pimentel (February 8, 1686) relates the scheming by which Pardo&rsquo;s
return from exile was facilitated. Another unsigned paper contains
&ldquo;news since the year 1688;&rdquo; the writer claims that his
intention is &ldquo;only that the truth may be known.&rdquo; This
account is mainly occupied with the fate of the auditors and other
officials who had incurred Pardo&rsquo;s wrath by taking part in his
banishment. They are subjected to imprisonment, privation, and exile; a
reign of terror prevails in Manila; and the governor is in close
alliance with the archbishop, so that there &ldquo;is no recourse,
except to God.&rdquo; The writer mentions several things in
condemnation of the governor&rsquo;s personal character, and regards
him as unscrupulous and tyrannical. Finally, the Dominican account of
this controversy is related by Vic&eacute;nte de Salazar, one of the
official historians of that order, in his biography of Pardo. In 1677
that prelate enters upon the vacant see of Manila; he finds many
ecclesiastical abuses and social scandals, and much official
corruption. Undertaking to correct these, he incurs the enmity of many
persons, and the ecclesiastical tribunal is filled with cases. For
nearly three years the relations of the archbishop with the governor
and Audiencia remain friendly; but finally (1680) certain ecclesiastics
under censure have recourse to the Audiencia against the
archbishop&rsquo;s authority, and this soon leads to hostilities
between the religious and secular branches of the government. Next the
cathedral chapter become insubordinate <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>to Pardo, their proper head, and they
too appeal to the Audiencia; and a long legal war ensues, in which the
weapons are official acts on both sides. At last (in 1682) the
Audiencia decree Pardo&rsquo;s banishment from his see, but hold this
measure in suspense for a time. He irritates the Jesuits, by proceeding
against one of their number who is acting as executor for an estate,
and seizes goods belonging to that order which are brought by the
Acapulco galleon; and soon the archbishop encounters complaints and
clamors from all sides. The decree of banishment is enforced, and Pardo
is arrested (March 31, 1683) and deported to the village of
Lingay&eacute;n, in the province of Pangasin&aacute;n. The cabildo
assume the government of the archbishopric, ignoring Pardo&rsquo;s
appointment of Barrientos to that office; and many of Pardo&rsquo;s
supporters are banished or otherwise chastised. A new governor coming
to the islands, the archbishop is reinstated in his see (November 16,
1685) and the case is afterward decided by the courts of Rome and
Madrid in his favor. He finds much to do in restoring his church to its
former condition, and defending the ecclesiastical rights and
privileges&mdash;an undertaking which keeps him engaged in conflicts,
but cannot abate his zeal and constancy. In the outcome he is
vindicated, even God taking vengeance on the enemies of the archbishop,
whose saintly qualities are extolled by Salazar. Pardo dies on December
31, 1689.</p>

<p>A royal official comes to the islands (1688) to bring suit against
the auditors who had banished the archbishop; but he finds that all of
them are dead, except Bolivar, and even he dies while on his way to
Manila. Accounts (<i>ca.</i> 1690) of Valdivia&rsquo;s proceedings
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>are
given by a Dominican and a Jesuit respectively (as appears from
internal evidence). He reconciles the Jesuits and the Dominicans in
Manila; sends Vargas, sentenced in residencia to pay 100,000 pesos, to
Pangasin&aacute;n; and sides with the archbishop in everything. This
encourages Pardo to continue taking vengeance on his enemies; and he
and Valdivia chastise whomsoever they will, in highly arbitrary
fashion&mdash;the visitor aiding Pardo in many cases, and in others
inflicting penalties on citizens of Manila in connection with purely
secular affairs. Vargas is sent into exile, the archbishop refusing to
the last to absolve him, notwithstanding the commands of the Audiencia.
The second letter, written from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (probably 1691),
apparently by a Jesuit, relates briefly the proceedings of Valdivia in
the islands. The writer sends a warning to combat the influences that
will be exerted at court to secure the see for Barrientos; and asserts
that Valdivia has appropriated to himself great wealth (part of which
has been seized) obtained from the Manila proceedings. The governor
died in April, 1690.</p>

</div>

<p>This Island is not subject to one Prince, neither is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>the Language one and
the same; but the People are much alike, in colour, strength, and
stature. They are all or most of them of one Religion, which is
Mahometanism, and their customs and manner of living are alike. The <i>
Mindanao</i> People, more particularly so called, are the greatest
Nation in the Island, and trading by Sea with other Nations, they are
therefore the more civil. I shall say but little of the rest, being
less known to me, but so much as hath come to my knowledge, take as
follows. There are besides the <i>Mindanayans</i>, the <i>
Hilanoones</i>, (as they call them) or the <i>Mountaneers</i>, the <i>
Sologues</i> and <i>Alfoores</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e354src"
href="#xd0e354">1</a></p>

<p>The <i>Hilanoones</i> live in the Heart of the Country: They have
little or no commerce by Sea, yet they have Proe&rsquo;s that row with
12 or 14 Oars apiece. They enjoy the benefit of the Gold Mines; and
with their Gold buy forreign Commodities of the <i>Mindanao</i> People.
They have also plenty of Bees-Wax, which they exchange for other
Commodities.</p>

<p>The <i>Sologues</i> inhabit the N.W. end of the Island.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e373src" href="#xd0e373">2</a> They are the least
Nation of all; they Trade to <i>Manila</i> in Proes, and to some of the
neighboring Islands, but have no Commerce with the <i>Mindanao</i>
People.</p>

<p>The <i>Alfoores</i> are the same with the <i>Mindanayans</i>, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>and were
formerly under the subjection of the Sultan of <i>Mindanao</i>, but
were divided among the Sultan&rsquo;s Children, and have of late had a
Sultan of their own; but having by Marriage contracted an alliance with
the Sultan of <i>Mindanao</i>, this has occasioned that Prince to claim
them again as his Subjects; and he made War with them a little after we
went away, as I afterwards understood.</p>

<p>The <i>Mindanayans</i> properly so called, are Men of mean statures;
small Limbs, straight Bodies, and little Heads. Their Faces are oval,
their Foreheads flat, with black small Eyes, short low Noses, pretty
large Mouths; their Lips thin and red, their Teeth black, yet very
sound, their Hair black and straight, the colour of their Skin tawney,
but inclining to a brighter yellow than some other <i>Indians</i>,
especially the Women. They have a Custom to wear their Thumb-nails very
long, especially that on their left Thumb, for they do never cut it but
scrape it often. They are indued with good natural Wits, are ingenious,
nimble, and active, when they are minded; but generally very lazy and
thievish, and will not work except forced by Hunger. This laziness is
natural to most <i>Indians</i>; but these People&rsquo;s lazinesz seems
rather to proceed not so much from their natural Inclinations, as from
the severity of their Prince of whom they stand in awe: For he dealing
with them very arbitrarily, and taking from them what they get, this
damps their Industry, so they never strive to have any thing but from
Hand to Mouth. They are generally proud, and walk very stately. They
are civil enough to Strangers, and will easily be acquainted with them,
and entertain them with great freedom; but they are implacable to their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>Enemies,
and very revengeful if they are injured, frequently poisoning secretly
those that have affronted them.</p>

<p>They wear but few Cloaths; their Heads are circled with a short
turban, fringed or laced at both ends; it goes once about the Head, and
is tied in a knot, the laced ends hanging down. They wear Frocks and
Breeches, but no Stockings nor Shooes.</p>

<p>The Women are fairer than the Men; and their Hair is black and long;
which they tie in a knot, that hangs back in their Poles. They are more
round visaged than the Men, and generally well featured; only their
Noses are very small, and so low between their Eyes, that in some of
the Female Children the rising that should be between the Eyes is
scarce discernable; neither is their any sensible rising in their
Foreheads. At a distance they appear very well; but being nigh, these
Impediments are very obvious. They have very small Limbs. They wear but
two Garments; a Frock, and a sort of Petticoat; the Petticoat is only a
piece of Cloth, sewed both ends together; but it is made two Foot too
big for their Wastes, so that they may wear either end uppermost; that
part that comes up to their Wastes, because it is so much too big, they
gather it in their Hands, and twist it till it fits close to their
Wastes, tucking in the twisted part between their Waste and the edge of
the Petticoat, which keeps it close. The Frock fits loose about them,
and reaches down a little below the Waste. The Sleeves are a great deal
longer than their Arms, and so small at the end, that their Hands will
scarce go through. Being on, the Sleeve fits in folds about the wrist,
wherein they take great pride.</p>

<p>The better sort of People have their Garments <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>made of long Cloth; but the
ordinary sort wear Cloth made of Plantain-tree, which they call
Saggen;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e422src" href="#xd0e422">3</a> by
which name they call the Plantain. They have neither Stocking or Shooe,
and the Women have very small Feet.</p>

<p>The Women are very desirous of the Company of Strangers, especially
White Men; and doubtless would be very familiar, if the Custom of the
Country did not debar them from that freedom, which seems coveted by
them. Yet from the highest to the lowest they are allowed liberty to
converse with, or treat strangers in the sight of their Husbands.</p>

<p>There is a kind of begging Custom at <i>Mindanao</i>, that I have
not met elsewhere with in all my Travels; and which I believe is owing
to the little Trade they have; which is thus: When Strangers arrive
here, the <i>Mindanao</i> Men will come aboard, and invite them to
their Houses, and inquire who has a <i>Comrade</i>, (which word I
believe they have from the <i>Spaniards</i>) or a <i>Pagally</i>, and
who has not. A <i>Comrade</i> is a familiar Male-friend; a <i>
Pagally</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e449src" href="#xd0e449">4</a> is
an innocent Platonick Friend of the other Sex. All Strangers are in a
manner oblig&rsquo;d to accept of this Acquaintance and Familiarity,
which must be first purchased with a small Present, and afterwards
confirmed with some Gift or other to continue the Acquaintance: and as
often as the Stranger goes ashore, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>he is welcome to his <i>Comrade</i> or <i>
Pagally&rsquo;s</i> House, where he may be entertained for his Money,
to Eat, Drink, or Sleep, and complimented, as often as he comes ashore,
with Tobacco and Betel-Nut, which is all the Entertainment he must
expect <i>gratis</i>. The richest Mens Wives are allow&rsquo;d the
freedom to converse with her <i>Pagally</i> in publick, and may give or
receive Presents from him. Even the Sultans and the Generals Wives, who
are always coopt up, will yet look out of their Cages when a Stranger
passeth by, and demand of him if he wants a <i>Pagally</i>: and to
invite him to their Friendship, will send a Present of Tobacco and
Betel-nut to him by their Servants.</p>

<p>The chiefest City on this Island is called by the same Name of <i>
Mindanao</i>. It is seated on the South side of the Island, in lat. 7
d. 20 m. N. on the banks of a small River, about two Mile from the Sea.
The manner of building is somewhat strange: yet generally used in this
Part of the <i>East-Indies</i>. Their House are all built on Posts,
about 14, 16, 18, or <i>20</i> Foot high. These Posts are bigger or
less, according to the intended magnificence of the Superstructure.
They have but one Floor, but many Partitions or Rooms, and a Ladder or
Stairs to go up out of the Streets. The Roof is large, and covered with
Palmeto or Palm-leaves. So there is a clear passage like a Piazza (but
a filthy one) under the House. Some of the poorer People that keep
Ducks or Hens, have a fence made round the Posts of their Houses, with
a Door to go in and out; and this Under-room serves for no other use.
Some use this place for the common draught of their Houses, but
building mostly close by the River in all parts of the <i>Indies</i>,
they make the River <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27">27</a>]</span>receive all the filth of their House; and at the
time of the Land-floods, all is washed very clean.</p>

<p>The Sultan&rsquo;s House is much bigger than any of the rest. It
stands on about 180 great Posts or Trees, a great deal higher than the
common Building, with great broad Stairs made to go up. In the first
Room he hath about 20 Iron Guns, all Saker and Minion, placed on
Field-Carriages. The General, and other great Men have some Guns also
in their Houses. About 20 paces from the Sultan&rsquo;s House there is
a small low House, built purposely for the Reception of Ambassadors or
Merchant Strangers. This also stands on Posts, but the Floor is not
raised above three or four Foot above the Ground, and is neatly Matted
purposely for the Sultan and his Council to sit on; for they use no
Chairs, but sit cross-legg&rsquo;d like Taylors on the Floor.</p>

<p>The common Food at <i>Mindanao</i> is Rice, or Sago, and a small
Fish or two. The better sort eat Buffalo, or Fowls ill drest, and
abundance of Rice with it. They use no Spoons to eat their Rice, but
every Man takes a handful out of the Platter, and by wetting his Hand
in Water, that it may not stick to his Hand, squeezes it into a lump,
as hard as possibly he can make it, and then crams it into his Mouth.
They all strive to make these lumps as big as their Mouths can receive
them; and seem to vie with each other, and glory in taking in the
biggest lump; so that sometimes they almost choke themselves. They
always wash after Meals, or if they touch any thing that is unclean;
for which reason they spend abundance of Water in their Houses. This
Water, with the washing of their Dishes, and what other filth they
make, they pour down near their Fire-place: for their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>Chambers are not
boarded, but floored with split Bamboes, like Lathe, so that the Water
presently falls underneath their dwelling Rooms, where it breeds
Maggots, and makes a prodigious stink. Besides this filthiness, the
sick People ease themselves, and make Water in their Chambers; there
being a small hole made purposely in the Floor, to let it drop through.
But healthy sound People commonly ease themselves, and make Water in
the River. For that reason you shall always see abundance of People, of
both Sexes in the River, from Morning till Night; some easing
themselves, others washing their bodies or Cloaths. If they come into
the River purposely to wash their Cloaths, they strip and stand naked
till they have done; then put them on, and march out again: both Men
and Women take great delight in swimming, and washing themselves, being
bred to it from their Infancy. I do believe it is very wholsom to wash
Mornings and Evenings in these hot Countries, at least three or four
Days in the Week: For I did use my self to it when I lived afterwards
at <i>Ben-cooly</i>, and found it very refreshing and comfortable. It
is very good for those that have Fluxes to wash and stand in the Rivers
Mornings and Evenings. I speak it experimentally; for I was brought
very low with that distemper at <i>Achin</i>; but by washing constantly
Mornings and Evenings I found great benefit, and was quickly cured by
it.</p>

<p>In the City of <i>Mindanao</i> they speak two Languages
indifferently: their own <i>Mindanao</i> Language, and the <i>
Malaya</i>; but in other parts or the Island they speak only their
proper Language, having little Commerce abroad. They have Schools, and
instruct the Children to Read and Write, and bring them up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>in the <i>
Mahometan</i> Religion. Therefore many of the words, especially their
Prayers, are in <i>Arabick</i>; and many of the words of civility the
same as in <i>Turkey</i>; and especially when they meet in the Morning,
or take leave of each other, they express themselves in that
Language.</p>

<p>Many of the old People, both Men and Women, can speak <i>
Spanish</i>, for the <i>Spaniards</i> were formerly settled among them,
and had several Forts on this Island; and then they sent two Friers to
the City, to convert the Sultan of <i>Mindanao</i> and his People. At
that time these People began to learn <i>Spanish</i>, and the <i>
Spaniards</i> incroached on them and endeavoured to bring them into
subjection; and probably before this time had brought them all under
their yoak, if they themselves had not been drawn off from this Island
to <i>Manila</i>, to resist the <i>Chinese</i>, who threatened to
invade them there. When the <i>Spaniards</i> were gone, the old Sultan
of <i>Mindanao</i>, Father to the present, in whose time it was, razed
and demolished their Forts, brought away their Guns, and sent away the
Friers; and since that time will not suffer the <i>Spaniards</i> to
settle on the Islands.</p>

<p>They are now most afraid of the <i>Dutch</i>, being sensible how
they have inslaved many of the Neighboring Islands. For that Reason
they have a long time desired the <i>English</i> to settle among them,
and have offered them any convenient Place to build a Fort in, as the
General himself told us; giving this Reason, that they do not find the
<i>English</i> so incroaching as the <i>Dutch</i> or <i>Spanish</i>.
The <i>Dutch</i> are no less jealous of their admitting the <i>
English</i>, for they are sensible what detriment it would be to them
if the <i>English</i> should settle here. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30">30</a>]</span></p>

<p>There are but few Tradesmen at the City of <i>Mindanao</i>. The
chiefest Trades are Goldsmiths, Blacksmiths, and Carpenters. There are
but two or three Goldsmiths; these will work in Gold or Silver, and
make any thing that you desire: but they have no Shop furnished with
Ware ready made for Sale. Here are several Blacksmiths who work very
well, considering the Tools that they work with. Their Bellows are much
different from ours. They are made of a wooden Cylinder, the Trunk of a
Tree, about three Foot long, bored hollow like a Pump, and set upright
on the ground, on which the Fire it self is made. Near the lower end
there is a small hole, in the side of the Trunk next the Fire, made to
receive a Pipe, through which the Wind is driven to the Fire by a great
bunch of fine Feathers fastened to one end of the Stick, which closing
up the inside of the Cylinder, drives the Air out of the Cylinder
through the Pipe: Two of these Trunks or Cylinders are placed so nigh
together, that a Man standing between them may work them both at once
alternately, one with each Hand. They have neither Vice nor Anvil, but
a great hard Stone or a piece of an old Gun, to hammer upon: yet they
will perform their work making both common Utensils and Iron-works
about Ships to admiration. They work altogether with Charcoal. Every
Man almost is a Carpenter, for they can work with the Ax and Adds.
Their Ax is but small, and so made that they can take it out of the
Helve, and by turning it make an Adds of it. They have no Saws; but
when they make Plank, they split the Tree in two, and make a Plank of
each part, plaining it with the Ax and Adds. This requires much pains,
and takes up a great deal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31">31</a>]</span>of time; but they work cheap, and the goodness of
the Plank thus hewed, which hath its grain preserv&rsquo;d entire,
makes amends for their cost and pains.</p>

<p>They build good and serviceable Ships or Barks for the Sea, some for
Trade, others for Pleasure; and some Ships of War. Their trading
Vessels they send chiefly to <i>Manila</i>. Thither they transport
Bees-wax, which, I think, is the only Commodity, besides Gold that they
vend there. The Inhabitants of the City of <i>Mindanao</i> get a great
deal of Bees-wax themselves: but the greatest quantity they purchase is
of the Mountaneers, from whom they also get the Gold which they send to
<i>Manila</i>; and with these they buy their Calicoes, Muslins, and <i>
China</i> Silk. They send sometimes their Barks to <i>Borneo</i> and
other Islands; but what they transport thither, or import from thence,
I know not. The <i>Dutch</i> come hither in Sloops from <i>Ternate</i>
and <i>Tidore</i>, and buy Rice, Bees-wax, and Tobacco: for there is a
great deal of Tobacco grown on this Island, more than in any Island or
Country in the <i>East-Indies</i>, that I know of, <i>Manila</i> only
excepted. It is an excellent sort of Tobacco; but these People have not
the Art of managing this Trade to their best advantage, as the <i>
Spaniards</i> have at <i>Manila</i>. I do believe the Seeds were first
brought hither from <i>Manila</i> by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and even
thither, in all probability, from <i>America</i>: the difference
between the <i>Mindanao</i> and <i>Manila</i> Tobacco is, that the <i>
Mindanao</i> Tobacco is of a darker colour; and the Leaf larger and
grosser than the <i>Manila</i> Tobacco, being propagated or planted in
a fatter Soil. The <i>Manila</i> Tobacco is of a bright yellow colour,
of an indifferent size, not strong, but Pleasant to Smoak. The <i>
Spaniards</i> at <i>Manila</i> are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>very curious about this Tobacco, having a
peculiar way of making it up neatly in the Leaf. For they take two
little Sticks, each about a Foot long, and flat, and placing the Stalks
of the Tobacco Leaves in a row, 40 or 50 of them between the two
Sticks, they bind them hard together, so that the Leaves hang dangling
down. One of these bundles is sold for a Rial at Fort <i>St.
George</i>: but you may have 10 or 12 pound of Tobacco at <i>
Mindanao</i> for a Rial: and the Tobacco is as good, or rather better
than the <i>Manila</i> Tobacco, but they have not that vent for it as
the <i>Spaniards</i> have.</p>

<p>The <i>Mindanao</i> People are much troubled with a sort of
Leprosie, the same as we observed at <i>Guam</i>. This Distemper runs
with a dry Scurf all over their Bodies, and causeth great itching in
those that have it, making them frequently scratch and scrub
themselves, which raiseth the outer skin in small whitish flakes, like
the scales of little Fish, when they are raised on end with a knife.
This makes their skin extraordinary rough, and in some you shall see
broad white spots in several parts of their Body. I judge such have had
it, but are cured; for their skins were smooth, and I did not perceive
them to scrub themselves: yet I have learnt from their own mouths that
these spots were from this Distemper. Whether they use any means to
cure themselves, or whether it goes away of it self, I know not: but I
did not perceive that they made any great matter of it, for they did
never refrain any Company for it; none of our People caught it of them,
for we were afraid of it, and kept off. They are sometimes troubled
with the Small Pox, but their ordinary Distempers are Fevers, Agues,
Fluxes, with great pains, and gripings <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>in their Guts. The Country affords a
great many Drugs and Medicinal Herbs, whose Virtues are not unknown to
some of them that pretend to cure the Sick.</p>

<p>The <i>Mindanao</i> Men have many Wives: but what Ceremonies are
used when they Marry I know not. There is commonly a great Feast made
by the Bridegroom to entertain his Friends, and the most part of the
Night is spent in Mirth.</p>

<p>The Sultan is absolute in his Power over all his Subjects. He is but
a poor Prince; for as I mentioned before, they have but little Trade,
and therefore cannot be rich. If the Sultan understands that any Man
has Money, if it be but 20 Dollars, which is a great matter among them,
he will send to borrow so much Money, pretending urgent occasions for
it; and they dare not deny him. Sometimes he will send to sell one
thing or another that he hath to dispose of, to such whom he knows to
have Money, and they must buy it, and give him his price; and if
afterwards he hath occasion for the same thing, he must have it if he
sends for it. He is but a little Man, between 50 or 60 Years old, and
by relation very good natured, but over-ruled by those about him.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e708src" href="#xd0e708">5</a> He has a Queen,
and keeps about 29 Women, or Wives more, in whose company he spends
most of his time. He has one Daughter by his Sultaness or Queen, and a
great many Sons and Daughters by the rest. These walk about the
Streets, and would be always begging <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>things of us; but it is reported that
the young Princess is kept in a Room, and never stirs out, and that she
did never see any Man but her Father and <i>Raja Laut</i> her Uncle,
being then about Fourteen Years Old.</p>

<p>When the Sultan visits his Friends, he is carried in a small Couch
on four Mens shoulders, with eight or ten armed Men to guard him; but
he never goes far this way; for the Country is very Woody, and they
have but little Paths, which render it the less commodious. When he
takes his pleasure by Water, he carries some of his Wives along with
him. The Proes that are built for this purpose, are large enough to
entertain 50 or 60 Persons or more. The Hull is neatly built, with a
round Head and Stern, and over the Hull there is a small slight House
built with Bamboes; the sides are made up with split Bamboes, about
four Foot high, with little Windows in them of the same, to open and
shut at their pleasure. The roof is almost flat, neatly thatched with
Palmeto Leaves. This House is divided into two or three small
Partitions or Chambers, one particularly for himself. This is neatly
Matted underneath, and round the sides; and there is a Carpet and
Pillows for him to sleep on. The second Room is for his Women, much
like the former. The third is for the Servants, who tend them with
Tobacco and Betel-Nut; for they are always chewing or smoking. The fore
and after-parts of the Vessel are for the Marriners to sit and Row.
Besides this, they have Outlayers, such as those I described at <i>
Guam</i>; only the Boats and Outlayers here are larger. These Boats are
more round, like the Half-Moon almost; and the Bamboes or Outlayers
that reach from the Boat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35">35</a>]</span>are also crooked. Besides, the Boat is not flat
on one side here, as at <i>Guam</i>; but hath a Belly and Outlayers on
each side: and whereas at <i>Guam</i> there is a little Boat
fasten&rsquo;d to the Outlayers, that lies in the Water; the Beams or
Bamboes here are fasten&rsquo;d traverse-wise to the Outlayers on each
side, and touch not the Water like Boats, but 1, 3 or 4 Foot above the
Water, and serve for the Barge Men to sit and Row and paddle on; the
inside of the Vessel, except only just afore and abaft, being taken up
with the apartments for the Passengers. There run a-cross the Outlayers
two tire of Beams for the Padlers to sit on, on each side the Vessel.
The lower tire of these Beams is not above a Foot from the Water: so
that upon any the least reeling of the Vessel, the Beams are dipt in
the Water, and the Men that sit are wet up to their Waste: their Feet
seldom escaping the Water. And thus as all our Vessels are Rowed from
within, these are Paddled from without.</p>

<p>The Sultan hath a Brother called <i>Raja Laut</i>, a brave Man. He
is the second Man in the Kingdom. All Strangers that come hither to
Trade must make their Address to him, for all Sea Affairs belong to
him. He Licenceth Strangers to Import or Export any Commodity, and
&rsquo;tis by his Permission that the Natives themselves are suffered
to Trade: Nay the very Fishermen must [t]ake a Permit from him: So that
there is no Man can come into the River or go out but by his leave. He
is two or three Years younger than the Sultan, and a little Man like
him. He has eight Women, by some of whom he hath Issue. He hath only
one Son, about twelve or fourteen Years old, who was Circumcised while
we were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36">36</a>]</span>there. His Eldest Son died a little before we
came hither, for whom he was still in great heaviness. If he had lived
a little longer he should have Married the young Princess, but whether
this second Son must have her I know not, for I did never hear any
Discourse about it. <i>Raja Laut</i> is a very sharp Man; he speaks and
writes <i>Spanish</i>, which he learned in his Youth. He has by often
conversing with Strangers, got a great sight into the Customs of other
Nations, and by <i>Spanish</i> Books has some knowledge of <i>
Europe</i>. He is General of the <i>Mindanayans</i>, and is accounted
an expert Soldier and a very stout Man; and the Women in their Dances,
Sing many Songs in his praise.</p>

<p>The Sultan of <i>Mindanao</i> sometimes makes War with his Neighbors
the <i>Mountaneers</i> or <i>Alfoores</i>. Their Weapons are Swords,
Lances and some Hand-Cressets. The Cresset<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e768src" href="#xd0e768">6</a> is a small thing like a Baggonet,
which they always wear in War or Peace, at Work or Play, from the
greatest of them to the poorest, or the meanest Persons. They do never
meet each other so as to have a pitcht Battle, but they build small
Works or Forts of Timber, wherein they plant little Guns, and lie in
sight of each other 2 or 3 Months, skirmishing every Day in small
Parties, and sometimes surprizing a Brestwork; and whatever side is
like to be worsted, if they have no probability to escape by flight,
they sell their lives as dear as they can; for there is seldom any
quarter given, but the Conqueror cuts and hacks his Enemies to
pieces.</p>

<p>The Religion of these People is Mahometanism, <i>Friday</i> is their
Sabbath; but I did never see any difference <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>that they make between this Day
and any other Day, only the Sultan himself goes then to the Mosque
twice. <i>Raja Laut</i> never goes to the Mosque, but Prays at certain
Hours, Eight or Ten times in a Day; where-ever he is, he is very
punctual to his Canonical Hours, and if he be aboard will go ashore, on
purpose to Pray. For no Business nor Company hinders him from this
Duty. Whether he is at home or abroad, in a House or in the Field, he
leaves all his Company, and goes about 100 Yards off, and there kneels
down to his Devotion. He first kisses the Ground, then prays aloud, and
divers times in his Prayers he kisses the Ground, and does the same
when he leaves off. His Servants, and his Wives and Children talk and
sing, or play how they please all the time, but himself is very
serious. The meaner sort of People have little Devotion: I did never
see any of them at their Prayers, or go into a Mosque.</p>

<p>In the Sultan&rsquo;s Mosque there is a great Drum with but one Head
called a <i>Gong</i>; which is instead of a Clock. This <i>Gong</i> is
beaten at 12 a Clock, at 3, 6, and 9; a Man being appointed for that
Service. He has a Stick as big as a Man&rsquo;s Arm, with a great knob
at the end, bigger than a Man&rsquo;s Fist, made with Cotton, bound
fast with small Cords: with this he strikes the <i>Gong</i> as hard as
he can, about 20 strokes; beginning to strike leisurely the first 5 or
6 strokes; then he strikes faster, and at last strikes as fast as he
can; and then he strikes again slower and slower so many strokes: thus
he rises and falls three times, and then leaves off till three Hours
after. This is done Night and Day.</p>

<p>They circumcise the Males at 11 or 12 Years of Age, or older; and
many are circumcised at once. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38">38</a>]</span>This Ceremony is performed with a great deal of
Solemnity. There had been no Circumcision for some Years before our
being here; and then there was one for <i>Raja Laut</i>&rsquo;s Son.
They chuse to have a general Circumcision when the Sultan, or General,
or some other great Person hath a Son fit to be Circumcised; for with
him a great many more are Circumcised. There is notice given about 8 or
10 Days before for all Men to appear in Arms, and great preparation is
made against the solemn Day. In the Morning before the Boys are
Circumcised, Presents are sent to the Father of the Child, that keeps
the Feast; which, as I said before, is either the Sultan, or some great
Person: and about 10 or 11 a Clock the <i>Mahometan</i> Priest does his
Office. He takes hold of the fore-skin with two Sticks, and with a pair
of Scissors snips it off. After this most of the Men, both in City and
Country being in Arms before the House, begin to act as if they were
ingaged with an Enemy, having such Arms as I described. Only one acts
at a time, the rest make a great Ring of 2 or 300 Yards round about
him. He that is to exercise comes into the Ring with a great shriek or
two, and a horrid look; then he fetches two or three large stately
strides, and falls to work. He holds his broad Sword in one Hand, and
his Lance in the other, and traverses his Ground, leaping from one side
of the Ring to the other; and in a menacing posture and look, bids
defiance to the Enemy, whom his Fancy frames to him; for there is
nothing but Air to oppose him. Then he stamps and shakes his Head, and
grinning with his Teeth, makes many ruful Faces. Then he throws his
Lance, and nimbly snatches out his Cresset, with which he hacks and
hews the Air <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39">39</a>]</span>like a Mad-man, often shrieking. At last, being
almost tired with motion, he flies to the middle of the Ring, where he
seems to have his Enemy at his Mercy, and with two or three blows cuts
on the Ground as if he was cutting off his Enemy&rsquo;s Head. By this
time he is all of a Sweat, and withdraws triumphantly out of the Ring,
and presently another enters with the like shrieks and gesture. Thus
they continue combating their imaginary Enemy all the rest of the Day:
towards the conclusion of which the richest Men act, and at last the
General, and then the Sultan concludes this Ceremony: He and the
General with some other great Men, are in Armor, but the rest have
none. After this the Sultan returns home, accompanied with abundance of
People who wait on him there till they are dismist. But at the time
when we were there, there was an after-game to be played; for the
General&rsquo;s Son being then Circumcised, the Sultan intended to give
him a second visit in the Night, so they all waited to attend him
thither. The General also provided to meet him in the best manner, and
therefore desired Captain <i>Swan</i> with his Men to attend him.
Accordingly Captain <i>Swan</i> ordered us to get our Guns, and wait at
the General&rsquo;s House till further Orders. So about 40 of us waited
till Eight a Clock in the Evening. When the General with Captain <i>
Swan</i>, and about 1000 Men, went to meet the Sultan, with abundance
of Torches that made it as light as Day. The manner of the march was
thus: First of all there was a Pageant, and upon it two dancing Women
gorgeously apparelled, with Coronets on their Heads, full of glittering
Spangles, and Pendants of the same, hanging down over their Breast and
Shoulders. These are Women bred up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"
href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>purposely for dancing: Their Feet and Legs
are but little imployed, except sometimes to turn round very gently;
but their Hands, Arms, Head and Body are in continual motion,
especially their Arms, which they turn and twist so strangely, that you
would think them to be made without Bones. Besides the two dancing
Women, there were two old Women in the Pageant, holding each a lighted
Torch in their Hands, close by the two dancing Women, by which light
the glittering Spangles appeared very gloriously. This Pageant was
carried by six lusty Men: Then came six or seven Torches, lighting the
General and Captain <i>Swan</i>, who marched side by side next, and we
that attended Captain <i>Swan</i> followed close after, marching in
order six and six abreast, with each Man his Gun on his Shoulder, and
Torches on each side. After us came twelve of the General&rsquo;s Men
with old <i>Spanish</i> Match-locks, marching four in a row. After them
about forty Lances, and behind them as many with great Swords, marching
all in order. After them came abundance only with Cressets by their
sides, who marched up close without any order. When we came near the
Sultan&rsquo;s House, the Sultan and his Men met us, and we
wheel&rsquo;d off to let them pass. The Sultan had three Pageants
[that] went before him: In the first Pageant were four of his Sons, who
were about 10 or 11 Years old. They had gotten abundance of small
Stones, which they roguishly threw about on the People&rsquo;s Heads.
In the next were four young Maidens, nieces to the Sultan, being his
Sisters Daughters; and in the 3d, there were three of the
Sultan&rsquo;s Children, not above six Years old. The Sultan himself
followed next, being carried in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>Couch, which was not like your <i>Indian
Palankins</i>, but open, and very little and ordinary. A multitude of
People came after, without any order: but as soon as he was past by,
the General, and Captain <i>Swan</i>, and all our Men, closed in just
behind the Sultan, and so all marched together to the General&rsquo;s
House. We came thither between 10 and 11 a Clock, where the biggest
part of the Company were immediately dismist; but the Sultan and his
Children, and his Nieces, and some other Persons of Quality, entred the
General&rsquo;s House. They were met at the Head of the Stairs by the
General&rsquo;s Women, who with a great deal of Respect conducted them
into the House. Captain <i>Swan</i>, and we that were with him followed
after. It was not long before the General caused his dancing Women to
enter the Room, and divert the Company with that pastime. I had forgot
to tell you that they have none but vocal Musick here, by what I could
learn, except only a row of a kind of Bells without Clappers, 16 in
number, and their weight increasing gradually from about three to ten
pound weight. These were set in a row on a Table in the General&rsquo;s
House, where for seven or eight Days together before the Circumcision
day, they were struck each with a little Stick, for the biggest part of
the Day making a great noise, and they ceased that Morning. So these
dancing Women sung themselves, and danced to their own Musick. After
this the General&rsquo;s Women, and the Sultan&rsquo;s Sons, and his
Nieces danced. Two of the Sultan&rsquo;s Nieces were about 18 or 19
Years Old, the other two were three or four Years Younger. These Young
Ladies were very richly drest, with loose garments of Silk, and small
Coronets on their Heads. They were much fairer <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>than any Women that I did ever
see there, and very well featured; and their Noses, tho&rsquo; but
small, yet higher than the other Womens, and very well proportioned.
When the Ladies had very well diverted themselves and the Company with
dancing, the General caused us to fire some Sky-rockets, that were made
by his and Captain <i>Swan</i>&rsquo;s Order, purposely for this Nights
Solemnity; and after that the Sultan and his retinue went away with a
few Attendants, and we all broke up, and thus ended this Days
Solemnity: but the Boys being sore with their Amputation, went
straddling for a fortnight after.</p>

<p>They are not, as I said before, very curious or strict in observing
any Days, or Times of particular Devotions, except it be <i>Ramdam</i>
[<i>i.e.</i>, Ramadan] time, as we call it. The <i>Ramdam</i> time was
then in <i>August</i>, as I take it, for it was shortly after our
arrival here. In this time they Fast all Day and about seven a Clock in
the Evening, they spend near an Hour in Prayer. Towards the latter end
of their Prayer, they loudly invoke their Prophet, for about a quarter
of an Hour, both old and young bawling out very strangely, as if they
intended to fright him out of his sleepiness or neglect of them. After
their Prayer is ended, they spend some time in Feasting before they
take their repose. Thus they do every Day for a whole Month at least;
for sometimes &rsquo;tis two or three Days longer before the <i>
Ramdam</i> ends: For it begins at the New Moon, and lasts till they see
the next New Moon, which sometimes in thick hazy Weather is not till
three or four Days after the Change, as it happen&rsquo;d while I was
at <i>Achin</i>, where they continued the <i>Ramdam</i> till the New
Moon&rsquo;s appearance. The next Day after they have seen the New
Moon, the Guns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43">43</a>]</span>are all discharged about Noon, and then the time
ends.</p>

<p>A main part of their Religion consists in washing often, to keep
themselves from being defiled; or after they are defiled to cleanse
themselves again. They also take great care to keep themselves from
being polluted, by tasting or touching any thing that is accounted
Unclean; therefore Swines Flesh is very abominable to them; nay, any
one that hath either tasted of Swines flesh, or touched those
Creatures, is not permitted to come into their Houses in many Days
after, and there is nothing will scare them more than a Swine. Yet
there are wild Hogs in the Islands, and those so plentiful, that they
will come in troops out of the Woods in the Night into the very City,
and come under their Houses, to romage up and down the Filth that they
find there. The Natives therefore would even desire to lie in wait for
the Hogs, to destroy them, which we did frequently, by shooting them
and carrying them presently on board, but were prohibited their Houses
afterwards.</p>

<p>And now I am on this Subject, I cannot omit a Story concerning the
General. He once desired to have a pair of Shoes made after the <i>
English</i> Fashion, tho&rsquo; he did very seldom wear any: So one
[of] our Men made him a Pair, which the General liked very well.
Afterwards some Body told him, That the Thread wherewith the Shoes were
sowed, were pointed with Hogs-bristles. This put him into a great
Passion; so he sent the Shoes to the Man that made them, and sent him
withal more Leather to make another Pair, with Threads pointed with
some other Hair, which was immediately done, and then he was well
pleased. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href=

<p>Having in the two last Chapters given some Account of the Natural,
Civil, and Religious State of <i>Mindanao</i>, I shall now go on with
the prosecution of our Affairs during our stay there.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Twas in a Bay on the N. East-side of the Island that we came
to an Anchor, as hath been said. We lay in this Bay but one Night, and
part of the next Day. Yet there we got Speech with some of the Natives,
who by signs made us to understand, that the City <i>Mindanao</i> was
on the West-side of the Island. We endeavored to persuade one of them,
to go with us to be our Pilot, but he would not: Therefore in the
Afternoon we loosed from hence, steering again to the South East,
having the Wind at S.W. When we came to the S.E. end of the Island <i>
Mindanao</i>, we saw two small Islands<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e966src" href="#xd0e966">7</a> about three Leagues distant from it.
We might have passed between them and the main Island, as we learnt
since, but not knowing them, nor what dangers we might encounter there,
we chose rather to Sail to the Eastward of them. But meeting very
strong Westerly Winds, we got nothing forward in many Days. In this
time we first saw the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46">46</a>]</span>Islands <i>Meangis</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e974src" href="#xd0e974">8</a> which are about 16 Leagues distant
from the <i>Mindanao</i>, bearing S.E. I shall have occasion to speak
more of them hereafter.</p>

<p>The 4th Day of <i>July</i> we got into a deep Bay, four Leagues N.W.
from the two small Islands before mentioned. But the Night before, in a
violent Tornado, our Bark being unable to beat any longer, bore away,
which put us in some pain for fear she was overset, as we had like to
have been our selves. We anchored on the South West side of the Bay, in
fifteen fathom Water, about a Cables length from the shore. Here we
were forced to shelter our selves from the violence of the Weather,
which was so boisterous with Rains, and Tornadoes, and a strong
Westerly Wind, that we were very glad to find this place to Anchor in,
being the only shelter on this side from the West Winds.</p>

<p>This Bay is not above two Mile wide at the Mouth, but farther in it
is three Leagues wide, and seven fathom deep, running in N.N.W. There
is a good depth of Water about four or five Leagues in, but Rocky foul
Ground for about two Leagues in, from the Mouth on both sides of the
Bay, except only in that place where we lay. About three Leagues in
from the mouth, on the Eastern side, there are fair sandy Bays, and
very good anchoring in four, five, and six fathom. The Land on the East
side is high, Mountainous, and Woody, yet very well watered with small
Brooks, and there is one River large enough for Canoes to enter. On the
West side of the Bay, the Land is of a mean height with a large
Savannah, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47">47</a>]</span>bordering on the Sea, and stretching from the
mouth of the Bay, a great way to the Westward.</p>

<p>This Savannah abounds with long Grass, and it is plentifully
stock&rsquo;d with Deer. The adjacent Woods are a covert for them in
the heat of the Day: but Mornings and Evenings they feed in the open
Plains, as thick as in our Parks in <i>England</i>. I never saw any
where such plenty of wild Deer, tho&rsquo; I have met with them in
several parts of <i>America</i>, both in the North and South Seas.</p>

<p>The Deer live here pretty peaceably and unmolested, for there are no
Inhabitants on that side of the Bay. We visited this Savannah every
Morning, and killed as many Deer as we pleased, sometimes 16 or 18 in a
Day; and we did eat nothing but Venison all the time we staid here.</p>

<p>We saw a great many Plantations by the sides of the Mountains, on
the East side of the Bay, and we went to one of them, in hopes to learn
of the Inhabitants whereabouts the City was, that we might not
over-sail it in the Night; but they fled from us.</p>

<p>We lay here till the 12th Day before the Winds abated of their fury,
and then we sailed from hence, directing our course to the Westward. In
the Morning we had a Land Wind at North. At 11 a Clock the Sea breeze
came at West, just in our Teeth, but it being fair Weather, we kept on
our way, turning and taking the advantage of the Land breezes by Night,
and the Sea breezes by Day.</p>

<p>Being now past the S.E. part of the Island, we coasted down on the
South side, and we saw abundance of Canoas a fishing, and now and then
a small Village. Neither were these Inhabitants afraid of us (as the
former) but came aboard; yet we could <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>not understand them, nor they us, but
by signs: and when we mentioned the word <i>Mindanao</i>, they would
point towards it.</p>

<p>The 18th Day of <i>July</i> we arrived before the River of <i>
Mindanao</i>; the mouth of which lies in lat. 6 d. 22 m. N. and is laid
in 231 d. 12 m. Longitude West, from the <i>Lizard</i> in <i>
England</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e1023src" href="#xd0e1023">9</a>.
We anchored right against the River in 15 fathom Water, clear hard
Sand; about 2 Miles from the shore, and 3 or 4 Miles from a small
Island, that lay without us to the Southward. We fired 7 or 9 Guns, I
remember not well which, and were answered again with 3 from the shore;
for which we gave one again. Immediately after our coming to an Anchor
<i>Raja Laut</i>, and one of the Sultan&rsquo;s Sons came off in a
Canoa, being rowed with 10 Oars, and demanded in <i>Spanish</i> what we
were? and from whence we came? Mr. <i>Smith</i> (he who was taken
Prisoner at <i>Leon</i> in <i>Mexico</i>) answered in the same
Language, that we were <i>English</i>, and that we had been a great
while out of <i>England</i>. They told us that we were welcome, and
asked us a great many questions about <i>England</i>; especially
concerning our <i>East India</i> Merchants; and whether we were sent by
them to settle a Factory here? Mr. <i>Smith</i> told them that we came
hither only to buy Provision. They seemed a little discontented when
they understood that we were not come to settle among them: for they
had heard of our arrival on the East-side of the Island a great while
before, and entertained hopes that we were sent purposely out of <i>
England</i> hither to settle a Trade with them; which it would seem
they are very desirous of. For Capt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span><i>Goodlud</i> had been here not long
before to treat with them about it; and when he went away told them (as
they said) that in a short time they might expect an Ambassador from
<i>England</i>, to make a full bargain with them.</p>

<p>Indeed upon mature thoughts, I should think we could not have done
better, than to have complied with the desire they seemed to have of
our settling here; and to have taken up our quarters among them. For as
thereby we might better have consulted our own profit and satisfaction,
than by the other loose roving way of life; so it might probably have
proved of publick benefit to our Nation, and been a means of
introducing an <i>English</i> Settlement and Trade, not only here, but
through several of the Spice-Islands, which lie in its
neighborhood.</p>

<p>For the Islands <i>Meangis</i>, which I mentioned in the beginning
of this Chapter, lye within twenty Leagues of <i>Mindanao</i>. These
are three small Islands that abound with Gold and Cloves, if I may
credit my Author Prince <i>Jeoly</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1082src" href="#xd0e1082">10</a> who was born on one of them, and
was at that time a Slave in the City of <i>Mindanao</i>. He might have
been purchased by us of his Master for a small matter, as he was
afte[r]wards by Mr. <i>Moody</i>, (who came hither to trade, and laded
a Ship with Clove-Bark) and by transporting him home to his own
Country, we might have gotten a Trade there. But of Prince <i>Jeoly</i>
I shall speak more hereafter. These Islands are as yet probably unknown
to the <i>Dutch</i>, who as I said before, indeavor to ingross all the
Spice into their own Hands.</p>

<p>There was another opportunity offered us here of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>settling on another
Spice-Island that was very well inhabited: for the Inhabitants fearing
the <i>Dutch</i>, and understanding that the English were settling at
<i>Mindanao</i>, their Sultan sent his Nephew to <i>Mindanao</i> while
we were there to invite us thither: Captain <i>Swan</i> conferr&rsquo;d
with him about it divers times, and I do believe he had some
Inclination to accept the offer; and I am sure most of the Men were for
it: but this never came to a head, for want of a true understanding
between Captain <i>Swan</i> and his Men, as may be declared
hereafter.</p>

<p>Beside the benefit that might accrue from this Trade with <i>
Meangis</i>, and other the Spice Islands, the <i>Philippine</i> Islands
themselves, by a little care and industry, might have afforded us a
very beneficial Trade, and all these Trades might have been managed
from <i>Mindanao</i>, by settling there first. For that Island lyeth
very convenient for Trading either to the Spice-Islands, or to the rest
of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands: since as its Soil is much of the same
nature with either of them, so it lies as it were in the Center of the
Gold and Spice Trade in these parts; the Islands North of <i>
Mindanao</i> abounding most in Gold, and those South of <i>Meangis</i>
in Spice.</p>

<p>As the Island <i>Mindanao</i> lies very convenient for Trade, so
considering its distance, the way thither may not be over-long and
tiresome. The Course that I would choose should be to set out of <i>
England</i> about the latter end of <i>August</i>, and to pass round <i
lang="es">Terra del Fuego</i>, and so stretching over towards <i>New
Holland</i>, coast it along that Shore till I came near to <i>
Mindanao</i>; or first I would coast down near the <i>American</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>Shore,
as far as I found convenient, and then direct my Course accordingly for
the Island. By this I should avoid coming near any of the <i>Dutch</i>
Settlements, and be sure to meet always with a constant brisk Easterly
Trade Wind, after I was once past <i>Terra del Fuego</i>. Whereas in
passing about the Cape of <i>Good Hope</i>, after you are shot over the
<i>East-Indian</i> Ocean, and are come to the Islands, you must pass
through the Streights of <i>Malacca</i> or <i>Sundy</i>, or else some
other Streights East from Java, where you will be sure to meet with
Country [<i>i.e.</i>, contrary] -winds, go on which side of the Equator
you please; and this would require ordinarily 7 or 8 Months for the
Voyage, but the other I should hope to perform in 6 or 7 at most. In
your return from thence also you must observe the same Rule as the <i>
Spaniards</i> do in going from <i>Manila to Acapulco</i>;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e1196src" href="#xd0e1196">11</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>only as they run
towards the North-Pole for variable Winds, so you must run to the
Southward, till you meet with a Wind that will carry you over to <i>
Terra del Fuego</i>. There are places enough to touch at for
Refreshment, either going or coming. You may touch going thither on
either side of <i>Terra Patagonica</i>, or, if you please, at the <i>
Gallapagoes Islands</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1311src" href=
"#xd0e1311">12</a> where there is Refreshment enough; and returning you
may probably touch somewhere on <i>New Holland</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>and so make some
profitable discovery in these Places without going out of your way. And
to speak my Thoughts freely, I believe &rsquo;tis owing to the neglect
of this easie way that all that vast Tract of <i>Terra Australis</i>
which bounds the <i>South Sea</i> is yet undiscovered: those that cross
that Sea seeming to design some Business on the <i>Peruvian</i> or <i>
Mexican</i> Coast, and so leaving that at a distance. To confirm which,
I shall add what Captain <i>Davis</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1342src" href="#xd0e1342">13</a> told me lately, That after his
departure from us at the Haven of <i>Ria Lexa</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1347src" href="#xd0e1347">14</a> (as is mentioned in the 8th
Chap.) he went after several Traverses, to the <i>Gallapagoes</i> and
that standing thus Southward for Wind, to bring him about <i>Terra del
Fuego</i>, in the Lat. of 27 South, about 500 Leagues from <i>
Copayapo</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1359src" href=
"#xd0e1359">15</a> on the Coast of <i>Chili</i>, he saw a small sandy
Island just by him; and that they saw to the Westward of it a long
Tract of pretty high Land, tending away toward the North West out of
sight. This might probably be the Coast of <i>Terra Australis
Incognita</i>.</p>

<p>But to return to <i>Mindanao</i>; as to the capacity we were then
in, of settling our selves at <i>Mindanao</i>, although we were not
sent out of any such design of settling, yet we were as well provided,
or better, considering all Circumstances, than if we had. For there was
scarce any useful Trade, but some or other <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>of us understood it. We had
Sawyers, Carpenters, Joyners, Brickmakers, Bricklayers, Shoemakers,
Taylors, <i>&amp;c.</i> we only wanted a good Smith for great Work;
which we might have had at <i>Mindanao</i>. We were very well provided
with Iron, Lead, and all sorts of Tools, as Saws, Axes, Hammers, <i>
&amp;c.</i> We had powder and Shot enough, and very good small Arms. If
we had designed to build a Fort, we could have spared 8 or 10 Guns out
of our Ship, and Men enough to have managed it, and any Affair of Trade
beside. We had also a great Advantage above raw Men that are sent out
of <i>England</i> into these places, who proceed usually too
cautiously, coldly and formally, to compass any considerable design,
which Experience better teaches than any Rules whatsoever; besides the
danger of their Lives in so great and sudden a change of Air: whereas
we were all inured to hot Climates, hardened by many Fatigues, and, in
general, daring Men, and such as would not be easily baffled. To add
one thing more, our Men were almost tired, and began to desire a <i>
quietus est</i>; and therefore they would gladly have seated themselves
any where. We had a good Ship too, and enough of us (beside what might
have been spared to manage our new Settlement) to bring the News with
the Effects to the Owners in <i>England</i>: for Captain <i>Swan</i>
had already 5000 <i>l.</i> in Gold, which he and his Merchants received
for Goods sold mostly to Captain <i>Harris</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1404src" href="#xd0e1404">16</a> and his Men: which if he had laid
but part of it out in Spice, as probably he might have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>done, would have
satisfy&rsquo;d the Merchants to their Hearts content. So much by way
of digression.</p>

<p>To proceed therefore with our first Reception at <i>Mindanao</i>,
<i>Raja Laut</i> and his Nephew sat still in their Canoa, and would not
come aboard us; because, as they said, they had no Orders for it from
the Sultan. After about half an Hour&rsquo;s Discourse, they took their
leaves, first inviting Captain <i>Swan</i> ashore, and promising him to
assist him in getting Provision; which they said at present was scarce,
but in three or four Month&rsquo;s time the Rice would be gathered in,
and then he might have as much as he pleased: and that in the mean time
he might secure his Ship in some convenient place, for fear of the
Westerly winds, which they said would be very violent at the latter end
of this Month, and all the next, as we found them.</p>

<p>We did not know the quality of these two Persons till after they
were gone; else we should have fir&rsquo;d some Guns at their
Departure: When they were gone, a certain Officer under the Sultan came
aboard and measured our Ship. A custom derived from the <i>Chinese</i>,
who always measure the length and breadth, and the depth of the Hold of
all Ships that come to load there; by which means they know how much
each Ship will carry. But for what reason this Custom is used either by
the <i>Chinese</i>, or <i>Mindanao</i> Men, I could never learn; unless
the <i>Mindanaians</i> design by this means to improve their skill in
Shipping, against they have a Trade.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Swan</i>, considering that the Season of the Year would
oblige us to spend some time at this Island, thought it convenient to
make what interest he could with the Sultan; who might afterwards <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>either
obstruct, or advance his designs. He therefore immediately provided a
Present to send ashore to the Sultan, <i>viz.</i> 3 Yards of Scarlet
Cloth, 3 Yards of broad Gold Lace, a Turkish Scimiter and a Pair of
Pistols: and to <i>Raja Laut</i> he sent 3 Yards of Scarlet Cloth, and
3 Yards of Silver Lace. This Present was carried by Mr. <i>Henry
More</i> in the Evening. He was first conducted to <i>Raja
Laut</i>&rsquo;s House; where he remained till report thereof was made
to the Sultan, who immediately gave order for all things to be made
ready to receive him.</p>

<p>About Nine a Clock at Night, a Messenger came from the Sultan to
bring the Present away. Then Mr. <i>More</i> was conducted all the way
with Torches and armed Men, till he came to the House where the Sultan
was. The Sultan with eight or ten Men of his Council were seated on
Carpets, waiting his coming. The Present that Mr. <i>More</i> brought
was laid down before them, and was very kindly accepted by the Sultan,
who caused Mr. <i>More</i> to sit down by them, and asked a great many
questions of him. The discourse was in <i>Spanish</i> by an
Interpreter. This Conference lasted about an Hour, and then he was
dismist, and returned again to <i>Raja Laut</i>&rsquo;s House. There
was a Supper provided for him, and the Boats Crew; after which he
returned aboard.</p>

<p>The next Day the Sultan sent for Capt. <i>Swan</i>: He immediately
went ashore with a Flag flying in the Boats Head, and two Trumpets
sounding all the way. When he came ashore, he was met at his Landing by
two principal Officers, guarded along with Soldiers, and abundance of
People gazing to see him. The Sultan waited for him in his Chamber of
Audience, where Captain <i>Swan</i> was treated with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>Tobacco and Betel,
which was all his Entertainment.</p>

<p>The Sultan sent for two <i>English</i> Letters for Captain <i>
Swan</i> to read, purposely to let him know, that our <i>East-India</i>
Merchants did design to settle here, and that they had already sent a
Ship hither. One of these Letters was sent to the Sultan from <i>
England</i>, by the <i>East-India</i> Merchants. The chiefest things
contained in it, as I remember, for I saw it afterwards in the
Secretaries Hand, who was very proud to shew it to us, was to desire
some privileges, in order to the building of a Fort there. This Letter
was written in a very fair Hand; and between each Line, there was a
Gold Line drawn. The other Letter was left by Captain <i>Goodlud</i>,
directed to any <i>English</i> Men who should happen to come thither.
This related wholly to Trade, giving an account, at what rate he had
agreed with them for Goods of the Island, and how European Goods should
be sold to them; with an account of their Weight and Measures, and
their difference from ours.</p>

<p>The rate agreed on for <i>Mindanao</i> Gold, was 14 <i>Spanish</i>
Dollars, (which is a current Coin all over <i>India</i>) the <i>
English</i> Ounce, and 18 Dollars the <i>Mindanao</i> Ounce. But for
Bees-wax and Clove-bark, I do not remember the rate neither do I well
remember the rates of <i>Europe</i> Commodities; but I think the rate
of Iron was not above four Dollars a Hundred. Captain <i>
Goodlud</i>&rsquo;s Letter concluded thus, <i>Trust none of them, for
they are all Thieves, but Tace is Latin for a Candle</i>. We understood
afterwards that Captain <i>Goodlud</i> was robb&rsquo;d of some Goods
by one of the General&rsquo;s Men, and that he that robb&rsquo;d him
was fled into the Mountains, and could not be found while Captain <i>
Goodlud</i> was here. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58">58</a>]</span>But the Fellow returning back to the City some
time after our arrival here, <i>Raja Laut</i> brought him bound to
Captain <i>Swan</i>, and told him what he had done, desiring him to
punish him for it as he pleased; but Captain <i>Swan</i> excused
himself; and said it did not belong to him, therefore he would have
nothing to do with it. However, the General <i>Raja Laut</i>, would not
pardon him, but punished him according to their own Custom, which I did
never see but at this time.</p>

<p>He was stript stark naked in the Morning at Sunrising, and bound to
a Post, so that he could not stir Hand nor Foot, but as he was
mov&rsquo;d; and was placed with his Face Eastward against the Sun. In
the Afternoon they turned his Face toward the West, that the Sun might
still be in his Face; and thus he stood all Day, parcht in the Sun
(which shines here excessively hot) and tormented with the Moskitos or
Gnats: After this the General would have kill&rsquo;d him, if Captain
<i>Swan</i> had consented to it. I did never see any put to Death; but
I believe they are barbarous enough in it: The General told us himself
that he put two Men to Death in a Town where some of us were with him;
but I heard not the manner of it. Their common way of punishing is to
strip them in this manner, and place them in the Sun; but sometimes
they lay them flat on their Backs on the Sand, which is very hot; where
they remain a whole Day in the scorching Sun, with the Moskito&rsquo;s
biting them all the time.</p>

<p>This action of the General in offering Captain <i>Swan</i> the
punishment of the Thief, caus&rsquo;d Captain <i>Swan</i> afterwards to
make him the same offer of his Men, when any had offended the <i>
Mindanao</i> Men: but the General left such Offenders to be punished
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>by
Captain <i>Swan</i>, as he thought convenient. So that for the least
Offence Captain <i>Swan</i> punished his Men, and that in the sight of
the <i>Mindanaians</i>; and I think sometimes only for revenge; as he
did once punish his Chief Mate Mr. <i>Teat</i>, he that came Captain of
the Bark to <i>Mindanao</i>. Indeed at that time Captain <i>Swan</i>
had his Men as much under command as if he had been in a King&rsquo;s
Ship; and had he known how to use his Authority, he might have led them
to any Settlement, and have brought them to assist him in any design he
had pleased.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Swan</i> being dismist from the Sultan, with abundance of
civility, after about two Hours Discourse with him, went thence to <i>
Raja Laut</i>&rsquo;s House. <i>Raja Laut</i> had then some difference
with the Sultan, and therefore he was not present at the Sultan&rsquo;s
reception of our Captain, but waited his return, and treated him and
all his Men with boiled Rice and Fowls. He then told Captain <i>
Swan</i> again, and urged it to him, that it would be best to get his
Ship into the River as soon as he could, because of the usual
tempestuous Weather at this time of the Year; and that he should want
no assistance to further him in any thing. He told him also, that as we
must of necessity stay here some time, so our Men would often come
ashore; and he therefore desired him to warn his Men to be careful to
give no afront to the Natives; who, he said, were very revengeful. That
their Customs being different from ours, he feared that Captain <i>
Swan</i>&rsquo;s Men might some time or other offend them, though
ignorantly; that therefore he gave him this friendly warning, to
prevent it: that his House should always be open to receive him or any
of his Men, and that he knowing our Customs, would never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>be offended at any
thing. After a great deal of such Discourse he dismist the Captain and
his Company, who took their leave and came aboard.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Swan</i> having seen the two Letters, did not doubt but
that the <i>English</i> did design to settle a Factory here: therefore
he did not much scruple the honesty of these People, but immediately
ordered us to get the Ship into the River. The River upon which the
City of <i>Mindanao</i> stands is but small, and hath not above 10 or
11 Foot Water on the Bar at a Spring-tide: therefore we lightened our
Ship, and the Spring coming on, we with much ado got her into the
River, being assisted by 50 or 60 <i>Mindanaian</i> Fishermen, who
liv&rsquo;d at the Mouth of the River; <i>Raja Laut</i> himself being
aboard our Ship to direct them. We carried her about a quarter of a
Mile up, within the Mouth of the River, and there moored her, Head and
Stern in a hole, where we always rode afloat. After this the Citizens
of <i>Mindanao</i> came frequently aboard, to invite our Men to their
Houses, and to offer us Pagallies. &rsquo;Twas a long time since any of
us had received such Friendship, and therefore we were the more easily
drawn to accept of their kindnesses; and in a very short time most of
our Men got a Comrade or two, and as many Pagallies; especially such of
us as had good Cloths, and store of Gold, as many had, who were of the
number of those, that accompanied Captain <i>Harris</i> over the
Isthmus of <i>Darien</i>, the rest of us being Poor enough. Nay, the
very Poorest and Meanest of us could hardly pass the Streets, but we
were even hal&rsquo;d by Force into their Houses, to be treated by
them; altho&rsquo; their Treats were but mean, <i>viz.</i> Tobacco, or
Betel-Nut, or a little sweet spiced Water. Yet their seeming Sincerity,
Simplicity, and the manner of bestowing these Gifts, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>made them very
acceptable. When we came to their Houses, they would always be praising
the <i>English</i>, as declaring that the <i>English</i> and <i>
Mindanaians</i> were all one. This they exprest by putting their two
Fore-fingers close together, and saying, that the <i>English</i> and
<i>Mindanaians</i> were <i>samo</i>, <i>samo</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1659src" href="#xd0e1659">17</a> that is, <i>all one</i>. Then
they would draw their Fore-fingers half a Foot asunder, and say the <i>
Dutch</i> and they were <i>Bugeto</i>, which signifies so, that they
were at such distance in point of Friendship: And for the <i>
Spaniards</i>, they would make a greater Representation of distance
than for the <i>Dutch</i>: Fearing these, but having felt, and smarted
from the <i>Spaniards</i>, who had once almost brought them under.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Swan</i> did seldom go into any House at first, but into
<i>Raja Laut</i>&rsquo;s. There he dined commonly every day; and as
many of his Men as were ashore, and had no Money to Entertain
themselves, resorted thither about 12 a Clock, where they had Rice
enough boiled and well drest, and some scraps of Fowls, or bits of
Buffaloe, drest very nastily. Captain <i>Swan</i> was served a little
better, and his two trumpeters sounded all the time that he was at
Dinner. After Dinner <i>Raja Laut</i> would sit and Discourse with him
most part of the Afternoon. It was now that <i>Ramdam</i> time,
therefore the General excused himself, that he could not Entertain our
Captain with Dances, and other Pastimes, as he intended to do when this
solemn Time was past; besides, it was the very height of the wet
Season, and therefore not so proper for Pastimes.</p>

<p>We had now very tempestuous Weather, and <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb62" href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>excessive Rains, which so
swell&rsquo;d the River, that it overflowed its Banks; so that we had
much ado to keep our Ship safe: For every now and then we should have a
great Tree come floating down the River, and sometimes lodge against
our Bows, to the endangering the breaking our Cables, and either the
driving us in, over the Banks, or carrying us out to Sea; both which
would have been very dangerous to us, especially being without
Ballast.</p>

<p>The City is about a Mile long (of no great breadth) winding with the
Banks of the River on the Right Hand going up, tho&rsquo; it hath many
Houses on the other side too. But at this time it seemed to stand as in
a Pond, and there was no passing from one House to another but in
Canoas. This tempestuous Rainy Weather happened the latter end of <i>
July</i>, and lasted most part of <i>August</i>.</p>

<p>When the bad Weather was a little asswaged, Captain <i>Swan</i>
hired a House to put our Sails and Goods in, while we careen&rsquo;d
our Ship. We had a great deal of Iron and Lead, which was brought
ashore into this House. Of these Commodities Captain <i>Swan</i> sold
to the Sultan or General, Eight or Ten Tuns, at the Rates agreed on by
Captain <i>Goodlud</i> to be paid in Rice. The <i>Mindanaians</i> are
no good Accomptants; therefore the <i>Chinese</i> that live here, do
cast up their Accompts for them. After this Captain <i>Swan</i> bought
Timber-trees of the General, and set some of our Men to Saw them into
Planks, to Sheath the Ship&rsquo;s bottom. He had two Whip-Saws on
Board, which he brought out of <i>England</i>, and four or five Men
that knew the use of them, for they had been Sawyers in <i>Jamaica</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63">63</a>]</span></p>

<p>When the <i>Ramdam</i> time was over, and the dry time set in a
little, the General, to oblige Captain <i>Swan</i>, entertained him
every Night with Dances. The dancing Women that are purposely bred up
to it, and make it their Trade, I have already described. But beside
them, all the Women in general are much addicted to Dancing. They Dance
40 or 50 at once; and that standing all round in a Ring, joined Hand in
Hand, and Singing and keeping time. But they never budge out of their
places, nor make any motion till the Chorus is Sung; then all at once
they throw out one Leg, and bawl out aloud; and sometimes they only
Clap their Hands when the Chorus is Sung. Captain <i>Swan</i>, to
retaliate the General&rsquo;s Favours, sent for his Violins, and some
that could Dance <i>English</i> Dances; wherewith the General was very
well pleased. They commonly spent the biggest part of the Night in
these sort of Pastimes.</p>

<p>Among the rest of our Men that did use to Dance thus before the
General, there was one <i>John Thacker</i>, who was a Seaman bred, and
could neither Write nor Read; but had formerly learnt to Dance in the
Musick-Houses about <i>Wapping</i>: This Man came into the <i>South
Seas</i> with Captain <i>Harris</i>, and getting with him a good
quantity of Gold, and being a pretty good Husband of his Share, had
still had some left, besides what he laid out in a very good Suit of
Cloaths. The General supposed by his Garb and his Dancing, that he had
been of noble Extraction; and to be satisfy&rsquo;d of his Quality,
asked of our Men, if he did not guess aright of him? The Man of whom
the General asked this Question told him, he was much in the right; and
that most of our Ship&rsquo;s Company <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>were of the like Extraction;
especially all those that had fine Cloaths; and that they came aboard
only to see the World, having Money enough to bear their expences
where-ever they came; but that for the rest, those that had but mean
Clothes, they were only common Seamen. After this, the General
shew&rsquo;d a great deal of Respect to all that had good Clothes, but
especially to <i>John Thacker</i>, till Captain <i>Swan</i> came to
know the Business, and marr&rsquo;d all; undeceiving the General, and
drubbing the Noble-Man: For he was so much incensed against <i>John
Thacker</i>, that he could never indure him afterwards; tho&rsquo; the
poor Fellow knew nothing of the Matter.</p>

<p>About the middle of <i>November</i> we began to work on our
Ship&rsquo;s bottom, which we found very much eaten with the Worm: For
this is a horrid place for Worms. We did not know this till after we
had been in the River a Month; and then we found our Canoas bottoms
eaten like Honey-combs; our Bark, which was a single bottom, was eaten
thro&rsquo;; so that she could not swim. But our Ship was sheathed, and
the Worm came no farther than the Hair between the sheathing Plank, and
the main Plank. We did not mistrust the General&rsquo;s Knavery till
now: for when he came down to our Ship, and found us ripping off the
sheathing Plank, and saw the firm bottom underneath, he shook his Head,
and seemed to be discontented; saying he did never see a Ship with two
bottoms before. We were told that in this place, where we now lay, a
<i>Dutch</i> Ship was eaten up in two months time, and the General had
all her Guns; and it is probable he did expect to have had Ours: Which
I do believe was the main Reason that made him so forward in assisting
us to get our Ship into the River, for when we went out again we had no
Assistance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65">65</a>]</span>from him. We had no Worms till we came to this
place: For when we Careen&rsquo;d at the <i>Marias</i>, the Worm had
not touch&rsquo;d us; nor at <i>Guam</i>, for there we scrubb&rsquo;d;
nor after we came to the Island <i>Mindanao</i>; for at the S.E. end of
the Island we heel&rsquo;d and scrubb&rsquo;d also. The <i>
Mindanaians</i> are so sensible of their destructive Insects, that
whenever they come from Sea, they immediately hale their Ship into a
dry Dock, and burn her bottom, and there let her lye dry till they are
ready to get to Sea again. The Canoas or Proes they hale up dry, and
never suffer them to be long in the Water. It is reported that those
Worms which get into a Ships bottom in the salt Water, will die in the
fresh Water; and that the fresh Water Worms will die in Salt Water: but
in brackish Water both sorts will increase prodigiously. Now this place
where we lay was sometimes brackish Water, yet commonly fresh; but what
sort of Worm this was I know not. Some Men are of Opinion, that these
Worms breed in the Plank; but I am perswaded they breed in the Sea: For
I have seen Millions of them swimming in the Water, particularly in the
Bay of <i>Panama</i>; for there Captain <i>Davis</i>, Captain <i>
Swan</i> and my self, and most of our Men, did take notice of them
divers times, which was the reason of our Cleaning so often while we
were there: and these were the largest Worms that I did ever see. I
have also seen them in <i>Virginia</i>, and in the Bay of <i>
Campeachy</i>; in the latter of which places the Worms eat
prodigiously. They are always in Bays, Creeks, Mouths of Rivers, and
such places as are near the shore; being never found far out at Sea,
that I could ever learn: yet a Ship will bring them lodg&rsquo;d in its
Plank for a great way.</p>

<p>Having thus ript off all our Worm-eaten Plank, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>and clapt on new, by
the beginning of <i>December</i> 1686, our Ships bottom was sheathed
and tallowed, and the 10th Day went over the Bar, and took aboard the
Iron and Lead that we could not sell, and began to fill our Water, and
fetch aboard Rice for our Voyage: But C. <i>Swan</i> remain&rsquo;d
ashore still, and was not yet determin&rsquo;d when to sail, or
whither. But I am well assured that he did never intend to Cruise about
<i>Manila</i>, as his Crew designed; for I did once ask him, and he
told me, That what he had already done of that kind he was forc&rsquo;d
to; but now being at Liberty, he would never more Engage in any such
Design: For, said he, there is no Prince on Earth is able to wipe off
the Stain of such Actions. What other Designs he had I know not, for he
was commonly very Cross; yet he did never propose doing any thing else,
but only ordered the Provision to be got Aboard in order to Sail; and I
am confident if he had made a motion to go to any <i>English</i>
Factory, most of his Men would have consented to it, tho&rsquo;
probably some would have still opposed it. How ever, his Authority
might soon have over-sway&rsquo;d those that were Refractory; for it
was very strange to see the Awe that these Men were in of him, for he
punished the most stubborn and daring of his Men. Yet when we had
brought the Ship out into the Road, they were not altogether so
submissive, as while it lay in the River, tho&rsquo; even then it was
that he punished Captain <i>Teat</i>.</p>

<p>I was at that time a Hunting with the General for Beef, which he had
a long time promised us. But now I saw that there was no Credit to be
given to his Word; for I was a Week out with him and saw but four Cows,
which were so wild, that we did not get <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb67" href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>one. There were five or six more of
our Company with me; these who were young Men, and had Dalilahs there,
which made them fond of the Place, all agreed with the General to tell
Captain <i>Swan</i>, that there were Beeves enough, only they were
wild. But I told him the Truth, and advised him not to be too credulous
of the General&rsquo;s Promises. He seemed to be very angry, and
stormed behind the General&rsquo;s Back, but in his Presence was very
mute, being a Man of small Courage.</p>

<p>It was about the 20th Day of <i>December</i> when we returned from
Hunting, and the General designed to go again to another place to Hunt
for Beef; but he stayed till after <i>Christmas-day</i>, because some
of us designed to go with him; and Captain <i>Swan</i> had desired all
his Men to be aboard that Day, that we might keep it solemnly together:
And accordingly he sent aboard a Buffaloe the Day before, that we might
have a good Dinner. So the 25th Day about 10 a Clock, Captain <i>
Swan</i> came aboard, and all his Men who were ashore: For you must
understand that near a third of our Men lived constantly ashore, with
their Comrades and Pagallies, and some with Women servants, whom they
hired of their Masters for Concubines. Some of our Men also had Houses,
which they hired or bought, for Houses are very cheap, for five or six
Dollars. For many of them having more Money than they knew what to do
with, eased themselves here of the trouble of telling it, spending it
very lavishly, their prodigality making the People impose upon them, to
the making the rest of us pay the dearer for what we bought, and to the
endangering the like impositions upon such <i>Englishmen</i> as may
come here hereafter. For the <i>Mindanaians</i> <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>knew how to get our Squires
Gold from them (for we had no Silver,) and when our Men wanted Silver,
they would change now and then an Ounce of Gold, and could get for it
no more than 10 or 11 Dollars for a <i>Mindanao</i> Ounce, which they
would not part with again under 18 Dollars. Yet this, and the great
prices the <i>Mindanaians</i> set on their Goods, were not the only way
to lessen their stocks; for their Pagallies and Comrades would often be
begging somewhat of them, and our Men were generous enough, and would
bestow half an Ounce of Gold at a time, in a Ring for their Pagallies,
or in a Silver Wrist-band, or Hoop to come about their Arms, in hopes
to get a Nights Lodging with them.</p>

<p>When we were all aboard on <i>Christmas-day</i>, Captain <i>Swan</i>
and his two Merchants; I did expect that Captain <i>Swan</i> would have
made some proposals, or have told us his designs; but he only dined and
went ashore again, without speaking any thing of his Mind. Yet even
then I do think that he was driving on a design, of going to one of the
Spice Islands, to load with Spice; for the Young Man before mentioned,
who I said was sent by his Unkle, the Sultan of a Spice Island near <i>
Ternate</i>, to invite the <i>English</i> to their Island, came aboard
at this time, and after some private Discourse with Captain <i>
Swan</i>, they both went ashore together. This Young Man did not care
that the <i>Mindanaians</i> should be privy to what he said. I have
heard Captain <i>Swan</i> say that he offered to load his Ship with
Spice, provided he would build a small Fort, and leave some Men to
secure the Island from the <i>Dutch</i>; but I am since informed, that
the Dutch have now got possession of the Island. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69">69</a>]</span></p>

<p>The next Day after <i>Christmas</i> the General went away again, and
five or six <i>Englishmen</i> with him, of whom I was one, under
pretence of going a hunting; and we all went together by Water in his
Proe, together with his Women and Servants, to the hunting place. The
General always carried his Wives and Children, his Money and Goods with
him: so we all imbarked in the Morning, and arrived there before Night.
I have already described the fashion of their Proes, and the Rooms made
in them. We were entertained in the General&rsquo;s Room or Cabbin. Our
Voyage was not so far, but that we reached our Port before Night.</p>

<p>At this time one of the General&rsquo;s Servants had offended, and
was punished in this manner: He was bound fast flat on his Belly, on a
Bamboe belonging to the Proe, which was so near the Water, that by the
Vessel&rsquo;s motion, it frequently delved under Water, and the Man
along with it; and sometimes when hoisted up, he had scarce time to
blow before he would be carried under Water again.</p>

<p>When we had rowed about two Leagues, we entered a pretty large deep
River, and rowed up a League further, the Water salt all the way. There
was a pretty large Village, the Houses built after the Country fashion.
We landed at this place, where there was a House made ready immediately
for us. The General and his Women lay at one end of the House, and we
at the other end, and in the Evening all the Women in the Village
danced before the General.</p>

<p>While he staid here, the General with his Men went out every Morning
betimes, and did not return till four or five a Clock in the Afternoon,
and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70">70</a>]</span>would often complement us, by telling us what
good Trust and Confidence he had in us, saying that he left his Women
and Goods under our Protection, and that he thought them as secure with
us six, (for we had all our Arms with us) as if he had left 100 of his
own Men to guard them. Yet for all this great Confidence, he always
left one of his principal Men, for fear some of us should be too
familiar with his Women.</p>

<p>They did never stir out of their own Room when the General was at
Home, but as soon as he was gone out, they would presently come into
our Room, and sit with us all Day, and ask a Thousand Questions of us
concerning our <i>English</i> Women, and our Customs. You may imagine
that before this time, some of us had attained so much of their
Language as to understand them, and give them Answers to their Demands.
I remember that one Day they asked how many Wives the King of <i>
England</i> had? We told them but one, and that our <i>English</i> Laws
did not allow of any more. They said it was a strange Custom, that a
Man should be confined to one Woman; some of them said it was a very
bad Law, but others again said it was a good Law; so there was a great
Dispute among them about it. But one of the General&rsquo;s Women said
positively, That our Law was better than theirs, and made them all
silent by the Reason which she gave for it. This was the <i>War
Queen</i>, as we called her, for she did always Accompany the General
whenever he was called out to Engage his Enemies, but the rest did
not.</p>

<p>By this Familiarity among the Women, and by often discoursing [with]
them, we came to be acquainted with their Customs and Priviledges. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>General
lies with his Wives by turns; but she by whom he had the first Son, has
a double Portion of his Company: For when it comes to her turn, she has
him two Nights, whereas the rest have him but one. She with whom he is
to lye at Night, seems to have a particular Respect shewn her by the
rest all the precedent Day; and for a Mark of distinction, wears a
striped silk Handkerchief about her Neck, by which we knew who was
Queen that Day.</p>

<p>We lay here about five or six Days, but did never in all that time
see the least sign of any Beef, which was the Business we came about;
neither were we suffered to go out with the General to see the wild
Kine, but we wanted for nothing else: However, this did not please us,
and we often importuned him to let go out among the Cattle. At last he
told us, That he had provided a Jar of Rice-drink to be merry with us,
and after that we should go with him.</p>

<p>This Rice-drink is made of Rice boiled and put into a Jar, where it
remains a long time steeping in Water. I know not the manner of making
it, but it is very strong pleasant Drink. The Evening when the General
designed to be merry, he caused a Jar of this Drink to be brought into
our Room, and he began to drink first himself, then afterwards his Men;
so they took turns till they were all as drunk as Swine, before they
suffered us to drink. After they had enough, then we drank, and they
drank no more, for they will not drink after us. The General leapt
about our Room a little while; but having his Load soon went to
sleep.</p>

<p>The next Day we went out with the General into the Savannah, where
we had near 100 Men making of a large Pen to drive the Cattle into. For
that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72">72</a>]</span>the manner of their Hunting, having no Dogs. But
I saw not above 8 or 10 Cows, and those as wild as Deer so that we got
none this Day: yet the next Day some of his Men brought in 3 Heifers,
which they kill&rsquo;d in the Savannah. With these we returned aboard,
they being all that we got there.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Swan</i> was much vext at the Generals Actions; for he
promised to supply us with as much Beef as we should want, but now
either could not, or would not make good his promise. Besides, he
failed to perform his Promise in a bargain of Rice, that we were to
have for the iron which he sold him, but he put us off still from time
to time, and would not come to any Account. Neither were these all his
Tricks; for a little before his Son was Circumcised, (of which I spake
in the foregoing Chapter) he pretended a great streight for Money, to
defray the Charges of that Day; and therefore desired Captain <i>
Swan</i> to lend him about 20 Ounces of Gold; for he knew that Captain
<i>Swan</i> had a considerable quantity of Gold in his possession,
which the General thought was his own, but indeed [he] had none but
what belonged to the Merchants. However he lent it the General, but
when he came to an Account with Captain <i>Swan</i>, he told him, that
it was usual at such solemn times to make Presents, and that he
received it as a Gift. He also demanded Payment for the Victuals that
our Captain and his Men did eat at his House. These things startled
Captain <i>Swan</i>, yet how to help himself he knew not. But all this,
with other inward troubles, lay hard on our Captain&rsquo;s Spirits,
and put him very much out of Humour; for his own Company also were
pressing him every Day to be gone, because, now was the heighth of the
Easterly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73">73</a>]</span>Monsoon, the only Wind to carry us farther into
the <i>Indies</i>.</p>

<p>About this time some of our Men, who were weary and tired with
wandring, ran away into the Country and absconded, they being assisted,
as was generally believed, by <i>Raja Laut</i>. There were others also,
who fearing we should not go to an <i>English</i> Port, bought a Canoa,
and designed to go in her to <i>Borneo</i>: For not long before a <i>
Mindanao</i> Vessel came from thence, and brought a Letter directed to
the chief of the <i>English</i> Factory at <i>Mindanao</i>. This Letter
the General would have Captain <i>Swan</i> have opened, but he thought
it might come from some of the <i>East-India</i> Merchants whose
Affairs he would not intermeddle with, and therefore did not open it. I
since met Captain <i>Bowry</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e1991src" href=
"#xd0e1991">18</a> at <i>Achin</i>, and telling him this Story, he said
that he sent that Letter, supposing that the <i>English</i> were
settled there at <i>Mindanao</i>, and by this Letter we also thought
that there was an <i>English</i> Factory at <i>Borneo</i>: so here was
a mistake on both sides. But this Canoa, wherewith some of them thought
to go to <i>Borneo</i>, Captain <i>Swan</i> took from them, and
threatned the Undertakers very hardly. However, this did not so far
discourage them, for they secretly bought another; but their Designs
taking Air, they were again frustrated by Captain <i>Swan</i>.</p>

<p>The whole Crew were at this time under a general Disaffection, and
full of very different Projects; and all for want of Action. The main
Division was between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74">74</a>]</span>those that had Money and those that had none.
There was a great Difference in the Humours of these; for they that had
Money liv&rsquo;d ashore, and did not care for leaving <i>Mindanao</i>;
whilst those that were poor liv&rsquo;d Aboard, and urg&rsquo;d Capt.
<i>Swan</i> to go to Sea. These began to be Unruly as well as
Dissatisfy&rsquo;d, and sent ashore the Merchants Iron to sell for Rack
and Honey, to make Punch, wherewith they grew Drunk and Quarelsome:
Which disorderly Actions deterr&rsquo;d me from going Aboard; for I did
ever abhor Drunkenness, which now our Men that were Aboard
abandon&rsquo;d themselves wholly to.</p>

<p>Yet these Disorders might have been crusht, if Capt. <i>Swan</i> had
used his Authority to Suppress them: But he with his Merchants living
always ashore, there was no Command; and therefore every Man did what
he pleased and encouraged each other in his Villanies. Now Mr. <i>
Harthop</i>, who was one of Captain <i>Swan</i>&rsquo;s Merchants, did
very much importune him to settle his Resolutions, and declare his Mind
to his Men; which at last he consented to do. Therefore he gave warning
to all his Men to come Aboard the 13th day of <i>January</i>, 1687.</p>

<p>We did all earnestly expect to hear what Captain <i>Swan</i> would
propose, and therefore were very willing to go Aboard. But unluckily
for him, two days before this Meeting was to be, Captain <i>Swan</i>
sent Aboard his Gunner, to fetch something ashore out of his Cabbin.
The Gunner rummaging to find what he was sent for, among other things
took out the Captain&rsquo;s Journal from <i>America</i> to the Island
<i>Guam</i>, and laid [it] down by him. This Journal was taken up by
one <i>John Read</i>, a <i>Bristol</i> man, whom I have mentioned in my
4th Chapter. He was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75">75</a>]</span>pretty Ingenious young Man, and of a very civil
carriage and behaviour. He was also accounted a good Artist, and kept a
Journal, and was now prompted by his curiosity, to peep into Captain
<i>Swan</i>&rsquo;s Journal, to see how it agreed with his own; a thing
very usual among Seamen that keep Journals, when they have an
opportunity, and especially young Men, who have no great experience. At
the first opening of the Book, he lights on a place in which Captain
<i>Swan</i> had inveighed bitterly against most of his Men, especially
against another <i>John Reed</i> a <i>Jamaica</i> man. This was such
stuff as he did not seek after: But hitting so pat on this subject, his
curiosity led him to pry farther; and therefore while the Gunner was
busie, he convey&rsquo;d the Book away, to look over it at his leisure.
The Gunner having dispatch&rsquo;d his business, lock&rsquo;d up the
Cabbin-door, not missing the Book, and went ashore. Then <i>John
Reed</i> shewed it to his Namesake, and to the rest that were aboard,
who were by this time the biggest part of them ripe for mischief; only
wanting some fair pretence to set themselves to work upon it. Therefore
looking on what was written in this Journal to be matter sufficient for
them to accomplish their Ends, Captain <i>Teat</i>, who as I said
before, had been abused by Captain <i>Swan</i>, laid hold on this
opportunity to be revenged for his Injuries, and aggravated the matter
to the height; perswading the Men to turn out Captain <i>Swan</i> from
being Commander, in hopes to have commanded the Ship himself. As for
the Sea-men they were easily perswaded to anything; for they were quite
tired with this long and tedious Voyage, and most of them despaired of
ever getting home, and therefore did not care what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>they did, or whither
they went. It was only want of being busied in some Action that made
them so uneasie; therefore they consented to what <i>Teat</i> proposed,
and immediately all that were aboard bound themselves by Oath to turn
Captain <i>Swan</i> out, and to conceal this design from those that
were ashore, until the Ship was under Sail; which would have been
presently, if the Surgeon or his Mate had been aboard; but they were
both ashore, and they thought it no Prudence to go to Sea without a
Surgeon: Therefore the next Morning they sent ashore one <i>John
Cookworthy</i>, to hasten off either the Surgeon or his Mate, by
pretending that one of the Men in the Night broke his Leg by falling
into the Hold. The Surgeon told him that he intended to come aboard the
next Day with the Captain, and would not come before: but sent his
Mate, <i>Herman Coppinger</i>.</p>

<p>This Man sometime before this, was sleeping at his Pegallies, and a
Snake twisted himself about his Neck; but afterwards went away without
hurting him. In this Country it is usual to have the Snakes come into
the Houses, and into the Ships too; for we had several come aboard our
Ship when we lay in the River. But to proceed, <i>Herman Coppinger</i>
provided to go aboard; and the next day, being the time appointed for
Captain <i>Swan</i> and all his Men to meet aboard, I went aboard with
him, neither of us mistrusted what was designing by those aboard, till
we came thither. Then we found it was only a trick to get the Surgeon
off; for now, having obtained their Desires, the Canoa was sent ashore
again immediately, to desire as many as they could meet to come aboard;
but not to tell the Reason, lest Captain <i>Swan</i> should come to
hear of it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77">77</a>]</span></p>

<p>The 13th Day in the Morning they weighed, and fired a Gun: Capt. <i>
Swan</i> immediately sent aboard Mr. <i>Nelly</i>, who was now his
chief Mate, to see what the matter was: To him they told all their
Grievances, and shewed him the Journal. He perswaded them to stay till
the next day, for an Answer from Captain <i>Swan</i> and the Merchants.
So they came to an Anchor again, and the next Morning Mr. <i>
Harthop</i> came aboard: He perswaded them to be reconciled again, or
at least to stay and get more Rice: But they were deaf to it, and
weighed again while he was aboard. Yet at Mr. <i>Harthop</i>&rsquo;s
Perswasion they promised to stay till 2 a Clock in the Afternoon for
Captain <i>Swan</i>, and the rest of the Men, if they would come
aboard; but they suffered no Man to go ashore, except one <i>William
Williams</i> that had a wooden Leg, and another that was a Sawyer.</p>

<p>If Capt. <i>Swan</i> had yet come aboard, he might have dash&rsquo;d
all their designs; but he neither came himself, as a Captain of any
Prudence and Courage would have done, nor sent till the time was
expired. So we left Captain <i>Swan</i> and about 36 Men ashore in the
City, and 6 or 8 that run away; and about 16 we had buried there, the
most of which died by Poison. The Natives are very expert at Poisoning,
and do it upon small occasions: Nor did our Men want for giving
Offence, through their general Rogueries, and sometimes by dallying too
familiarly with their Women, even before their Faces. Some of their
Poisons are slow and lingering; for we had some now aboard who were
Poison&rsquo;d there; but died not till some Months after. <span class=

<p>The 14th Day of <i>January</i>, 1687, at 3 of the Clock in the
Afternoon we sailed from the River of <i>Mindanao</i>, designing to
cruise before <i>Manila</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2280src" href=
"#xd0e2280">19</a></p>

<p>[During their stay at Mindanao the English first notice the change
of time due to their having journeyed westward. There and in other
places they find the people reckoning a full day ahead of themselves,
due to the fact that the Portuguese had journeyed thither to the
eastward. The computation at the Ladrones is the same as their own.
&ldquo;But how the reckoning was at <i>Manila</i>, and the rest of the
<i>Spanish</i> Colonies in the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, I know not;
whether they keep it as they brought it, or corrected it by the
Accounts of the Natives, and of the <i>Portuguese</i>, <i>Dutch</i> and
<i>English</i>, coming the contrary way from <i>Europe</i>.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>We had the Wind at N.N.E. fair clear Weather, and a brisk Gale. We
coasted to the Westward, on the South-side of the Island of <i>
Mindanao</i>, keeping within 4 or 5 Leagues of the Shore. The Land from
hence tends away W. by S. It is of a good height by the Sea, and very
woody, and in the Country we saw high Hills.</p>

<p>The next Day we were abrest of <i>Chambongo</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>Zamboanga]; a
Town in this Island, and 30 Leagues from the River of <i>Mindanao</i>.
Here is said to be a good Harbour, and a great Settlement, with plenty
of Beef and Buffaloe. It is reported that the <i>Spaniards</i> were
formerly fortified here also: There are two shoals lie off this place,
2 or 3 Leagues from the Shoar. From thence the Land is more low and
even; yet there are some Hills in the Country.</p>

<p>About 6 Leagues before we came to the West-end of the Island <i>
Mindanao</i>, we fell in with a great many small low Islands or Keys,
and about two or three Leagues to the Southward of these Keys, there is
a long Island stretching N.E. and S.W. about 12 Leagues.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e2337src" href="#xd0e2337">20</a> This Island is low
by the Sea on the North-side, and has a Ridge of Hills in the middle,
running from one end to the other. Between this Isle and the small
Keys, there is a good large Channel: Among the Keys also there is a
good depth of Water, and a violent Tide; but on what point of the
Compass it flows, I know not, nor how much it riseth and falls.</p>

<p>The 17th Day we anchored on the East-side of all these Keys, in 8
fathom Water, clean Sand. Here are plenty of green Turtle, whose flesh
is as sweet as any in the <i>West Indies</i>: but they are very shy. A
little to the Westward of these Keys, on the Island <i>Mindanao</i>, we
saw abundance of Coco-nut Trees: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>Therefore we sent our Canoa ashore, thinking
to find Inhabitants, but found none, nor sign of any; but great Tracts
of Hogs, and great Cattle; and close by the Sea there were Ruins of an
old Fort. The Walls thereof were of a good heighth, built with Stone
and Lime; and by the Workmanship seem&rsquo;d to be <i>Spanish</i>.
From this place the Land trends W.N.W. and it is of an indifferent
heighth by the Sea. It runs on this point of the Compass 4 or 5
Leagues, and then the Land trends away N.N.W. 5 or 6 Leagues farther,
making with many bluff Points.</p>

<p>We weigh&rsquo;d again the 14th Day, and went thro&rsquo; between
the Keys; but met such uncertain Tides, that we were forced to anchor
again. The 22d day we got about the Westermost Point of all <i>
Mindanao</i>, and stood to the Northward, plying under the Shore, and
having the Wind at N.N.E. a fresh Gale. As we sailed along further, we
found the Land to trend N.N.E. On this part of the Island the Land is
high by the Sea, with full bluff Points, and very woody. There are some
small Sandy Bays, which afford Streams of fresh Water.</p>

<p>Here we met with two Prows [<i>i.e.</i>, praus] belonging to the <i>
Sologues</i>, one of the <i>Mindanaian</i> Nations before mentioned.
They came from <i>Manila</i> laden with Silks and Calicoes. We kept on
this Western part of the Island steering Northerly, till we came abrest
of some other of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, that lay to the
Northward of us; then steered away towards them; but still keeping on
the West-side of them, and we had the Winds at N.N.E.</p>

<p>The 3d of <i>February</i> we anchored in a good Bay on the West side
of the Island, in Lat. 9 d. 55 min. where we had 13 Fathom-water, good
soft Oaze. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82">82</a>]</span>This Island hath no Name that we could find in
any Book, out lieth on the West side of the Island <i>Sebo</i>.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2391src" href="#xd0e2391">21</a> It is about 8
or 10 Leagues long, mountainous and woody. At this place Captain <i>
Read</i>, who was the same Captain <i>Swan</i> had so much railed
against in his Journal, and was now made Captain in his room (as
Captain <i>Teat</i> was made Master, and Mr. <i>Henry More</i>
Quarter-Master) ordered the Carpenters to cut down our Quarter-Deck, to
make the Ship snug, and the fitter for sailing. When that was done, we
heeled her, scrubbed her Bottom, and tallowed it. Then we fill&rsquo;d
all our Water, for here is a delicate small run of Water.</p>

<p>The Land was pretty low in this Bay, the Mould black and fat, and
the Trees of several Kinds, very thick and tall. In some places we
found plenty of Canes,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2408src" href=
"#xd0e2408">22</a> such as we use in <i>England</i> for Walking-Canes.
These were short-jointed, not above two Foot and a half, or two Foot
ten Inches the longest, and most of them not above two Foot. They run
along on the Ground like a Vine; or taking hold of the Trees, they
climb up to their very tops. They are 15 or 20 Fathom long, and much of
a bigness from the Root, till within 5 or 6 Fathom of the end. They are
of a pale green Colour, cloathed over with a Coat of short thick hairy
Substance, of a dun Colour; but it comes off by only drawing the Cane
through your Hand. We did cut many of them, and they proved very tough
heavy Canes.</p>

<p>We saw no Houses, nor sign of Inhabitants; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>while we lay here,
there was a Canoa with 6 Men came into this Bay; but whither they were
bound, or from whence they came, I know not. They were <i>Indians</i>,
and we could not understand them.</p>

<p>In the middle of this Bay, about a Mile from the Shore, there is a
small low woody Island, not above a Mile in Circumference; our Ship
rode about a Mile from it. This Island was the Habitation of an
incredible number of great Batts, with Bodies as big as Ducks, or large
Fowl, and with vast Wings: For I saw at <i>Mindanao</i> one of this
sort, and I judge that the Wings stretcht out in length, could not be
less assunder than 7 or 8 Foot from tip to tip; for it was much more
than any of us could fathom with our Arms extended to the utmost. The
Wings are for Substance like those of other Batts, of a Dun or Mouse
colour. The Skin or Leather of them hath Ribs running along it, and
draws up in 3 or 4 Folds; and at the joints of those Ribs and the
Extremities of the Wings, there are sharp and crooked Claws, by which
they may hang on any thing. [A further description of the great bats
and their habits follows.] At this Isle also we found plenty of Turtle
and Manatee, but no Fish.</p>

<p>We stay&rsquo;d here till the 10th of <i>February</i>, 1687, and
then having compleated our Business, we sailed hence with the Wind at
North. But going out we struck on a Rock, where we lay two Hours: It
was very smooth Water, and the Tide of Flood, or else we should have
lost our Ship. We struck off a great piece of our Rudder, which was all
the damage that we received, but we more narrowly mist losing our Ships
this time, than in any other in the whole Voyage. This is a very
dangerous Shoal, because it does <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>not break, unless probably it may appear in
foul Weather. It lies about two mile to the Westward, without the small
Batt Island. Here we found the Tide of Flood setting to the Southward,
and the Ebb to the Northward.</p>

<p>After we were past this Shoal, we Coasted along by the rest of the
<i>Philippine</i> Islands, keeping on the West-side of them. Some of
them appeared to be very Mountainous dry Land. We saw many Fires in the
Night as we passed by <i>Panay</i>, a great Island settled by <i>
Spaniards</i>, and by the Fires up and down it seems to be well settled
by them; for this is a <i>Spanish</i> Custom, whereby they give Notice
of any Danger or the like from Sea; and &rsquo;tis probable they had
seen our Ship the day before. This is an unfrequented Coast, and
&rsquo;tis rare to have any Ship seen there. We touched not at <i>
Panay</i>, nor any where else; tho&rsquo; we saw a great many small
Islands to the Westward of us, and some Shoals, but none of them laid
down in our Draughts.</p>

<p>The 18th Day of <i>Feb.</i> we anchored at the N.W. end of the
Island <i>Mindora</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2458src" href=
"#xd0e2458">23</a> in 10 Fathom-water, about 3 quarters of a Mile from
the Shore. <i>Mindora</i> is a large Island; the middle of it lying in
Lat. 13. about 40 Leagues long, stretching N.W. and S.E. It is High and
Mountainous, and not very Woody. At this Place where we anchored the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>Land was
neither very high nor low. There was a small Brook of Water, and the
Land by the Sea was very Woody, and the Trees high and tall, but a
League or two farther in, the Woods are very thin and small. Here we
saw great tracks of Hogs and Beef, and we saw some of each, and hunted
them; but they were wild, and we could kill none.</p>

<p>While we were here, there was a Canoa with 4 <i>Indians</i> came
from <i>Manila</i>. They were very shy of us a while: but at last,
hearing us speak <i>Spanish</i>, they came to us, and told us, that
they were going to a Fryer that liv&rsquo;d at an <i>Indian</i> Village
towards the S.E. end of the Island. They told us also, that the Harbour
of <i>Manila</i> is seldom or never without 20 or 30 Sail of Vessels,
most <i>Chinese</i>, some <i>Portugueze</i>, and some few the <i>
Spaniards</i> have of their own. They said, that when they had done
their business with the Fryer they would return to <i>Manila</i>, and
hoped to be back again at this place in 4 Days time. We told them, that
we came for a Trade with the <i>Spaniards</i> at <i>Manila</i>, and
should be glad if they would carry a Letter to some Merchant there,
which they promised to do. But this was only a pretence of ours, to get
out of them what intelligence we could as to their Shipping, Strength,
and the like, under Colour of seeking a Trade; for our business was to
pillage. Now if we had really designed to have Traded there, this was
as fair an opportunity as Men could have desired: for these Men could
have brought us to the Frier that they were going to, and a small
Present to him would have engaged him to do any kindness in the way of
Trade: for the <i>Spanish</i> Governors do not allow of it, and we must
Trade by stealth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86">86</a>]</span></p>

<p>The 21st Day we went from hence with the Wind at E.N.E. a small
gale. The 23d Day in the Morning we were fair by the <i>S.E.</i> end of
the Island <i>Luconia</i>, the Place that had been so long desired by
us. We presently saw a Sail coming from the Northward, and making after
her we took her in 2 Hours time. She was a <i>Spanish</i> Bark, that
came from a place called <i>Pangasanam</i>, a small town on the N. end
of <i>Luconia</i>, as they told us; probably the same with <i>
Pagassinay</i>, which lies on a Bay at the N. W. side of the Island.
She was bound to <i>Manila</i> but had no goods aboard; and therefore
we turned her away.</p>

<p>The 23d. we took another <i>Spanish</i> Vessel that came from the
same place of the other. She was laden with Rice and Cotton-Cloth, and
bound for <i>Manila</i> also. These Goods were purposely for the <i>
Acapulco</i> Ship: The Rice was for the Men to live on while they lay
there, and in their return: and the Cotton-cloth was to make Sail. The
Master of this Prize was Boatswain of the <i>Acapulco</i> Ship which
escaped us at <i>Guam</i>, and was now at <i>Manila</i>. It was this
Man that gave us the Relation of what Strength it had, how they were
afraid of us there, and of the accident that happen&rsquo;d to them, as
is before mentioned in the 10th Chapter. We took these two Vessels
within 7 or 8 Leagues of <i>Manila</i>.</p>

<p><i>Luconia</i> I have spoken of already: but I shall now add this
further account of it. It is a great Island, taking up between 6 and 7
degrees of Lat. in length, and its breadth near the middle is about 60
Leagues; but the ends are narrow. The North end lies in about 19 d.
North Lat. and the S. end in about 12 d. 30 m. This great Island hath
abundance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87">87</a>]</span>of small Keys or Islands lying about it;
especially at the North-end. The South-side fronts towards the rest of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands: Of these that are its nearest
Neighbours, <i>Mindora</i>, lately mentioned, is the chief, and gives
name to the Sea or Streight that parts it and the other Islands from
<i>Luconia</i>: being called the Streights of <i>Mindora</i>.</p>

<p>The Body of the Island <i>Luconia</i> is composed of many spacious
plain Savannahs, and large Mountains. The North-end seems to be more
plain and even, I mean freer from Hills, than the South-end: but the
Land is all along of a good heighth. It does not appear so flourishing
and green as some of the other Islands in this Range; especially that
of St. <i>John</i>, <i>Mindanao</i>, <i>Batt</i> Island, <i>&amp;c.</i>
yet in some places it is very Woody. Some of the Mountains of this
Island afford Gold, and the Savannahs are well stockt with herds of
Cattle, especially Buaffaloes[<i>sic</i>]. These Cattle are in great
plenty all over the <i>East-Indies</i>; and therefore &rsquo;tis very
probable that there were many of these here even before the <i>
Spaniards</i> come hither. But now there are now also plenty of other
Cattle, as I have been told, as Bullocks, Horses, Sheep, Goats, Hogs,
<i>&amp;c.</i> brought hither by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p>It is pretty well inhabited with <i>Indians</i>, most of them, if
not all, under the <i>Spaniards</i>, who now are masters of it. The
Native <i>Indians</i> do live together in Towns; and they have Priests
among them to instruct them in the <i>Spanish</i> Religion.</p>

<p><i>Manila</i> the chief, or perhaps the only City, lies at the foot
of a ridge of high Hills, facing upon a spacious Harbour near the S.W.
point of the Island, in about the Lat. of 14 d. North. It is
environ&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88">88</a>]</span>with a high strong Wall, and very well
fortify&rsquo;d with Forts and Breast-works. The Houses are large,
strongly built, and covered with Pan-tile. The Streets are large and
pretty regular; with a Parade in the midst, after the <i>Spanish</i>
fashion. There are a great many fair Buildings, beside Churches and
other Religious Houses; of which there are not a few.</p>

<p>The Harbour is so large, that some hundreds of Ships may ride here:
and is never without many, both of their own and strangers. I have
already given you an account of the two Ships going and coming between
this place and <i>Acapulco</i>. Besides them, they have some small
Vessels of their own; and they do not allow the <i>Portuguese</i> to
trade here, but the <i>Chinese</i> are the chiefest Merchants, and they
drive the greatest Trade; for they have commonly 20 or 30, or 40 Jonks
in the Harbour at a time, and a great many Merchants constantly
residing in the City, beside Shop-keepers, and Handy-crafts-men in
abundance. Small Vessels run up near the Town, but the <i>Acapulco</i>.
Ships and others of greater burthen, lye a League short of it, where
there is a strong Fort also, and Store-houses to put Goods in.</p>

<p>I had the major part of this relation 2 or 3 years after this time,
from Mr. <i>Coppinger</i> our Surgeon, for he made a Voyage hither from
<i>Porto Nova</i>, a Town on the Coast of <i>Coromandel</i>; in a <i>
Portuguese</i> Ship, as I think. Here he found 10 or 12 of Captain <i>
Swan&rsquo;s</i> men; some of those that we left at <i>Mindanao</i>.
For after we came from thence, they brought a Proe there, by the
Instigation of an <i>Irish man</i>, who went by the name of <i>John
Fitz-Gerald</i>, a person that spoke <i>Spanish</i> very well; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>so in
this their Proe they came hither. They had been here but 18 months when
Mr. <i>Coppinger</i> arrived here, and Mr. <i>Fitz-Gerald</i> had in
this time gotten a Spanish Mustesa Woman to Wife, and a good Dowry with
her. He then professed Physick and Surgery, and was highly esteemed
among the <i>Spaniards</i> for his supposed knowledge in those Arts:
for being always troubled with sore Shins while he was with us, he kept
some Plaisters and Salves by him; and with these he set up upon his
bare natural stock of knowledge, and his experience in Kibes. But then
he had a very great stock of Confidence withal, to help out the other,
and being an <i>Irish Roman</i> Catholick, and having the <i>
Spanish</i> Language he had a great advantage of all his Consorts; and
he alone lived well there of them all. We were not within sight of this
Town, but I was shewn the Hills that over-looked it, and drew a draft
of them as we lay off at Sea; which I have caused to be engraven among
a few others that I took my self:....</p>

<p>[The season for successful operations near Manila having passed, the
mutineers decide to go to some islands near the Cambodian shore to wait
until about May, the time for the Acapulco galleon, choosing those
islands as they were somewhat retired. The prisoners are set ashore on
the island of Luzon, and that island is left February 26. On March 14
anchor is cast on Pulo (or Island) Condore, the largest and only
inhabited one of those islands which lie in north latitude 8&deg;
40&rsquo;. A short description of the islands, their products, fauna,
and inhabitants (who are Cochinchinese) and some of their customs
follows. At this island the ship is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>careened and refitted. There also &ldquo;2
of our Men died, who were poison&rsquo;d at <i>Mindanao</i>, they told
us of it when they found themselves poison&rsquo;d, and had
linger&rsquo;d ever since. They were opened by our Doctor, according to
their own Request before they died, and their Livers were black, light
and dry, like pieces of Cork.&rdquo; After filling the water-butts
anchor is weighed (April 21) and the course taken to Pulo Ubi near
Siam, reaching that island April 23. From that date until May 13 they
cruise about the bay of Siam where they are becalmed. May 24 they
anchor again at Pulo Condore, together with a Chinese vessel laden with
pepper from Sumatra; from its men they learn that the
&ldquo;<i>English</i> were settled in the Island <i>Sumatra</i>, at a
place called <i>Sillabar</i>; and the first knowledge we had that the
<i>English</i> had any settlement on <i>Sumatra</i> was from
these.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2721src" href=
"#xd0e2721">24</a> An attempt there to investigate a Malayan vessel
ends fatally for a number of the English; for the Malays, thinking them
to be pirates, set upon the boarding party, and kill a number of them.
At that island also the surgeon, Herman Coppinger, attempts to escape,
but is taken back to the ship. Dampier is only deterred from making the
same attempt because he desires a more convenient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>opportunity.
&ldquo;For neither he nor I, when we were last on board at <i>
Mindanao</i>, had any knowledge of the Plot that was laid to leave
Captain <i>Swan</i>, and run away with the Ship; and being sufficiently
weary of this mad Crew, we were willing to give them the slip at any
place from whence we might hope to get a passage to an <i>English</i>
Factory.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>[The first part of this chapter, as is seen by the above list of
contents, relates to China and islands near the Chinese coast. Most of
the second half of the chapter relates to the Bashee or Batanes Islands
and is as follows.]</p>

<p>We stayed here [<i>i.e.</i>, at the Piscador Islands near <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>China] till
the 29th Day [of July, 1687], and then sailed from hence with the Wind
at S.W. and pretty fair Weather. We now directed our course for some
Islands we had chosen to go to, that lye between <i>Formosa</i> and <i>
Luconia</i>. They are laid down in our Plots without any name, only
with a figure of 5, denoting the number of them. It was supposed by us,
that these Islands had no Inhabitants, because they had not any name by
our Hydrographers. Therefore we thought to lye there secure, and be
pretty near the Island <i>Luconia</i>, which we did still intend to
visit.</p>

<p>In going to them we sailed by the South West end of <i>Formosa</i>,
leaving it on our Larboard-side. This is a large Island; the South-end
is in Lat. 21 d. 20 m. and the North-end in 25 d. 10 m. North Lat. the
Longitude of this Island is laid down 142 d. 5 m. to 143 d. 16 m.
reckoning East from the Pike of <i>Tenariffe</i>, so that &rsquo;tis
but narrow; and the Tropick of <i>Cancer</i> crosses it. It is a High
and Woody Island, and was formerly well inhabited by the <i>
Chinese</i>, and was then frequently visited by <i>English</i>
Merchants, there being a very good Harbour to secure their Ships. But
since the <i>Tartars</i> have conquered <i>China</i>, they have spoiled
the Harbour, (as I have been informed) to hinder the <i>Chinese</i>
that were then in Rebellion, from Fortifying themselves there; and
ordered the Foreign Merchants to come and Trade on the Main.</p>

<p>The sixth day of <i>August</i> we arrived at the five Islands that
we were bound to, and anchored on the East-side of the Northermost
Island, in 15 Fathom, a Cable&rsquo;s length from the Shore. Here,
contrary to our Expectation, we found abundance of Inhabitants <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>in sight; for
there were 3 large Towns all within a League of the Sea; and another
larger Town than any of the three, and the backside of a small Hill
close by also, as we found afterwards. These Islands lie in Lat. 20 d.
20 m. North Lat. by my Observation, for I took it there, and I find
their Longitude according to our Drafts, to be 141 d. 50 m. These
Islands having no particular Names in the Drafts, some or other of us
made use of the Seamens priviledge, to give them what Names we pleased.
Three of the Islands were pretty large; the Westermost is the biggest.
This the Dutchmen who were among us called the Prince of <i>
Orange&rsquo;s</i> Island, in honour of his present Majesty. It is
about 7 or 8 Leagues long, and about two Leagues wide; and it lies
almost N. and S. The other two great Islands are about 4 or 5 Leagues
to the Eastward of this. The Northermost of them, where we first
anchored, I called the Duke of <i>Grafton&rsquo;s</i> Isle, as soon as
we landed on it; having married my W[i]fe out of his Dutchess&rsquo;s
Family, and leaving her at <i>Arlington</i>-house, at my going Abroad.
This Isle is about 4 Leagues long, and one League and a half wide,
stretching North and South. The other great Island our Seamen called
the Duke of <i>Monmouth&rsquo;s</i> Island. This is about a League to
the Southward of <i>Grafton</i> Isle. It is about 3 Leagues long, and a
League wide, lying as the other. Between <i>Monmouth</i> and the South
end of <i>Orange</i> Island, there are two small Islands of a roundish
Form, lying East and West. The Eastermost Island of the two, our Men
unanimously called <i>Bashee</i> Island,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2954src" href="#xd0e2954">25</a> from <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>a Liquor which we drank there
plentifully every day, after we came to an Anchor at it. The other,
which is the smallest of all, we called <i>Goat</i> Island, from the
great number of Goats there; and to the Northward of them all, are two
high Rocks.</p>

<p><i>Orange</i> Island, which is the biggest of them all, is not
Inhabited. It is high Land, flat and even on the top, with steep Cliffs
against the Sea; for which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98">98</a>]</span>Reason we could not go ashore there, as we did on
all the rest.</p>

<p>[Some general remarks on high and low lands and anchorages nearby
follow, in which the author states almost as an axiom that good
anchorages are found near low lands, while high rocky lands have poor
anchorages.]</p>

<p>But to return from this Digression, to speak of the rest of these
Islands. <i>Monmouth</i> and <i>Grafton</i> Isles are very Hilly, with
many of those steep inhabited Precipi[c]es on them, that I shall
describe particularly. The two small Islands are flat and even; only
the <i>Bashee</i> Island hath one steep scraggy Hill, but Goat Island
is all flat and very even.</p>

<p>The Mold of these Islands in the Valley, is blackish in some places,
but in most red. The Hills are very rocky: The Valleys are well watered
with Brooks of fresh Water, which run into the Sea in many different
places. The Soil is indifferent fruitful, especially in the Valleys;
producing pretty great plenty of Trees (tho&rsquo; not very big) and
thick Grass. The sides of the Mountains have also short Grass; and some
of the Mountains have Mines within them, or the Natives told us, That
the yellow Metal they shewed us, (as I shall speak more particularly)
came from these Mountains; for when they held it up they would point
towards them.</p>

<p>The fruit of the Islands are a few Plantains, Bonanoes, Pineapples,
Pumkins, Sugar-canes, <i>&amp;c.</i> and there might be more if the
Natives would, for the Ground seems fertile enough. Here are great
plenty of Potatoes, and Yames, which is the common Food for the
Natives, for Bread-kind: For those few Plantains they have, are only
used as Fruit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99">99</a>]</span>They have some Cotton growing here of the small
Plants.</p>

<p>Here are plenty of Goats, and abundance of Hogs; but few Fowls,
either wild or tame. For this I have always observed in my Travels,
both in the <i>East</i> and <i>West Indies</i>, that in those Places
where there is plenty of Grain, that is, of Rice in one, and Maiz in
the other, there are also found great abundance of Fowls; but on the
contrary, few Fowls in those Countries where the Inhabitants feed on
Fruits and Roots only. The few wild Fowls that are here, are Parakites,
and some other small Birds. Their tame Fowl are only a few Cocks and
Hens.</p>

<p><i>Monmouth</i> and <i>Grafton</i> Islands are very thick inhabited;
and <i>Bashee</i> Island hath one Town on it. The Natives of these
Islands are short squat People; they are generally round visaged, with
low Foreheads, and thick Eye-brows; their Eyes of a hazle colour, and
small, yet bigger than the <i>Chinese</i>; short low Noses, and their
Lip and Mouths middle proportioned. Their Teeth are white; their Hair
is black, and thick, and lank, which they wear but short; it will just
cover their Ears, and so it is cut round very even. Their Skins are of
a very dark copper colour.</p>

<p>They wear no Hat, Cap, nor Turban, nor any thing to keep off the
Sun. The Men for the biggest part have only a small Clout to cover
their Nakedness; some of them have Jackets made of Plantain-leaves,
which were as rough as any Bear&rsquo;s-skin: I never saw such rugged
Things. The Women have a short Petticoat made of Cotton, which comes a
little below their Knees. It is a thick sort of stubborn Cloth, which
they make themselves of their Cotton. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>Both Men and Women do wear large
Ear-rings, made of that yellow Metal before mentioned. Whether it were
Gold or no I cannot positively say: I took it to be so; it was heavy,
and of the colour of our paler Gold. I would fain have brought away
some to have satisfied my Curiosity; but I had nothing where with to
buy any. Captain <i>Read</i> bought two of these Rings with some Iron,
of which the People are very greedy; and he would have bought more,
thinking he was come to a very fair Market, but that the paleness of
the Metal made him and the Crew distrust its being right Gold. For my
part, I should have ventured on the purchase of some, but having no
property in the Iron, of which we had great store on board, sent from
<i>England</i>, by the Merchants along with Captain <i>Swan</i>, I
durst not barter it away.</p>

<p>These Rings when first polished look very gloriously, but time makes
them fade, and turn to a pale yellow. Then they make a soft Paste of
red Earth, and smearing it over their Rings, they cast them into a
quick Fire, where they remain till they be red hot; then they take them
out and cool them in Water, and rub off the Paste; and they look again
of a glorious Colour and Lustre.</p>

<p>These People make but small low Houses. The sides which are made of
small Posts, watled with Boughs, are not above 4 foot and a half high:
the Ridge-pole is about 7 or 8 foot high. They have a Fire-place at one
end of their Houses, and Boards placed on the Ground to lye on. They
inhabit together in small Villages built on the sides and tops of rocky
Hills, 3 or 4 rows of Houses one above another, and on such steep
Precipices, that they go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101">101</a>]</span>up to the first Row with a wooden Ladder, and
so with a Ladder still from every Story up to that above it, there
being no way to ascend. The Plain on the first Precipice may be so
wide, as to have room both for a Row of Houses that stand all along on
the Edge or Brink of it, and a very narrow Street running along before
their Doors, between the Row of Houses and the foot of the next
Precipice; the Plain of which is in a manner level to the tops of the
Houses below, and so for the rest. The common Ladder to each Row or
Street comes up at a narrow Passage left purposely about the middle of
it; and the Street being bounded with a Precipice also at each end,
&rsquo;tis but drawing up the Ladder, if they be assaulted, and then
there is no coming at them from below, but by climbing up as against a
perpendicular Wall: And that they may not be assaulted from above, they
take care to build on the side of such a Hill, whose backside hangs
over the Sea, or is some high, steep, perpendicular Precipice,
altogether inaccessible. These Precipices are natural; for the Rocks
seem too hard to work on; nor is there any sign that Art hath been
employed about them. On <i>Bashee</i> Island there is one such, and
built upon, with its back next the Sea. <i>Grafton</i> and <i>
Monmouth</i> Isles are very thick set with these Hills and Towns; and
the Natives, whether for fear of Pirates, or Foreign Enemies, or
Factions among their own Clans, care not for Building but in these
Fastnesses; which I take to be the Reason that <i>Orange</i> Isle,
though the largest, and as Fertile as any, yet being Level, and
exposed, hath no Inhabitants. I never saw the like Precipices and
Towns.</p>

<p>These Towns are pretty Ingenious also in building <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>Boats. Their
small Boats are much like our <i>Deal</i> Yalls, but not so big; and
they are built with very narrow Plank, pinn&rsquo;d with wooden Pins,
and some Nails. They have also some pretty large Boats, which will
carry 40 or 50 Men. These they Row with 12 or 14 Oars of a side. They
are built much like the small ones, and they Row doubled Banked; that
is, two Men setting on one Bench, but one Rowing on one side, the other
on the other side of the Boat. They understand the use of Iron, and
work it themselves. Their Bellows are like those at <i>
Mindanao</i>.</p>

<p>The common Imployment for the Men is Fishing; but I did never see
them catch much: Whether it is more plenty at other times of the Year I
know not. The Women do manage their Plantations.</p>

<p>I did never see them kill any of their Goats or Hogs for themselves,
yet they would beg the Panches of the Goats that they themselves did
sell to us: And if any of our surly Seamen did heave them into the Sea,
they would take them up again, and the Skins of the Goats also. They
would not meddle with Hog-guts, if our Men threw away any beside what
they made Chitterlings and Sausages of. The Goat-skins these People
would carry ashore, and making a Fire they would singe oft all the
Hair, and afterwards let the Skin lie and Pearch on the Coals, till
they thought it eatable; and then they would knaw it, and tear it to
pieces with their Teeth, and at last swallow it. The Paunches of the
Goats would make them an excellent Dish; they drest it in this manner.
They would turn out all the Chopt Grass and Crudities found in the Maw
into their Pots, and set it over the Fire, and stir it about often:
This would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103">103</a>]</span>Smoak and Puff, and heave up as it was Boyling;
wind breaking out of the Ferment, and making a very savory Stink. While
this was doing, if they had any Fish, as commonly they had 2 or 3 small
Fish, these they would make very clean (as hating nastiness belike) and
cut the Flesh from the Bone, and then mince the Flesh as small as
possibly they could, and when that in the Pot was well boiled, they
would take it up, and strewing a little Salt into it, they would eat
it, mixt with their raw minced Flesh. The Dung in the Maw would look
like so much boil&rsquo;d Herbs minc&rsquo;d very small; and they took
up their Mess with their Fingers, as the <i>Moors</i> do their Pilaw,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e3069src" href="#xd0e3069">26</a> using no
Spoons.</p>

<p>They had another Dish made of a sort of Locusts, whose Bodies were
about an Inch and an half long, and as thick as the top of one&rsquo;s
little Finger; with large thin Wings, and long and small Legs. At this
time of the Year these Creatures came in great Swarms to devour their
Potato-leaves, and other Herbs; and the Natives would go out with small
Nets, and take a Quart at one sweep. When they had enough, they would
carry them home, and Parch them over the Fire in an earthen Pan; and
then their Wings and Legs would fall off, and their Heads and Backs
would turn red like boil&rsquo;d Shrimps, being before brownish. Their
Bodies being full, would eat very moist, their Heads would crackle, in
one&rsquo;s Teeth. I did eat once of this Dish, and liked it well
enough; but their other Dish my Stomach would not take.</p>

<p>Their common Drink is Water; as it is of all other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104">104</a>]</span><i>Indians</i>:
Beside which they make a sort of Drink with the Juice of the
Sugar-cane, which they boil, and put some small black sort of Berries
among it. When it is well boiled, they put it into great Jars, and let
it stand 3 or 4 days and work. Then it settles and becomes clear, and
is presently fit to drink. This is an excellent Liquor, and very much
like <i>English</i> Beer, both in Colour and Taste. It is very strong,
and I do believe very wholesome: For our Men, who drunk briskly of it
all day for several Weeks, were frequently drunk with it, and never
sick after it. The Natives brought a vast deal of it every day to those
aboard and ashore: For some of our Men were ashore at work on <i>
Bashee</i> Island; which Island they gave that Name to from their
drinking this Liquor there; that being the Name which the Natives
call&rsquo;d this Liquor by: and as they sold it to our Men very cheap,
so they did not spare to drink it as freely. And indeed from the plenty
of this Liquor, and their plentiful use of it, our Men call&rsquo;d all
these Islands, the <i>Bashee</i> Islands.</p>

<p>What Language these People do speak I know not: for it had no
affinity in sound to the <i>Chinese</i>, which is spoke much through
the Teeth; nor yet to the <i>Malayan</i> Language. They called the
Metal that their Ear-rings were made of <i>Bullawan</i>, which is the
<i>Mindana</i> word for Gold; therefore probably they may be related to
the <i>Philippine Indians</i>; for that is the general Name for Gold
among all those <i>Indians</i>. I could not learn from whence they have
their Iron; but it is most likely they go in their great Boats to the
North end of <i>Luconia</i>, and Trade with the <i>Indians</i> of that
Island for it. Neither did I see any thing beside Iron, and pieces of
Buffaloes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105">105</a>]</span>Hides, which I could judge that they bought of
Strangers: Their Cloaths were of their own Growth and Manufacture.</p>

<p>These Men had Wooden Lances, and a few Lances headed with Iron;
which are all the Weapons that they have. Their Armour is a piece of
Buffaloe-hide, shaped like our Carters Frocks, being without Sleeves,
and sowed both sides together, with holes for the Head and the Arms to
come forth. This Buff-Coat reaches down to their Knees: It is close
about their Shoulders, but below it is 3 Foot wide, and as thick as a
Board.</p>

<p>I could never perceive them to Worship any thing, neither had they
any Idols; neither did they seem to observe any one day more than
other. I could never perceive that one Man was of greater Power than
another; but they seemed to be all equal; only every Man ruling his own
House, and the Children Respecting and Honouring their Parents.</p>

<p>Yet &rsquo;tis probable that they have some Law, or Custom, by which
they are govern&rsquo;d; for while we lay here we saw a young Man
buried alive in the Earth; and &rsquo;twas for Theft, as far as we
could understand from them. There was a great deep hole dug, and
abundance of People came to the Place to take their last Farewell of
him: Among the rest, there was one Woman who made great Lamentation,
and took off the condemn&rsquo;d Person&rsquo;s Ear-rings. We supposed
her to be his Mother. After he had taken his leave of her and some
others, he was put into the Pit, and covered over with Earth He did not
struggle, but yielded very quietly to his Punishment; and they
cramm&rsquo;d the Earth close upon him, and stifled him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>

<p>They have but one Wife, with whom they live and agree very well; and
their Children live very obediently under them. The Boys go out a
Fishing with their Fathers; and the Girls live at home with their
Mothers: And when the Girls are grown pretty strong, they send them to
their Plantations, to dig Yames and Potatoes; of which they bring home
on their Heads every day enough to serve the whole Family; for they
have no Rice nor Maize.</p>

<p>Their Plantations are in the Valleys, at a good distance from their
Houses; where every Man has a certain spot of Land, which is properly
his own. This he manageth himself for his own use; and provides enough,
that he may not be beholding to his Neighbour.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the seeming nastiness of their Dish of Goats Maw,
they are in their Persons a very neat cleanly People, both Men and
Women: And they are withal the quietest and civilest People that I did
ever meet with. I could never perceive them to be angry with one
another. I have admired to see 20 or 30 Boats aboard our Ship at a
time, and yet no difference among them; but all civil and quiet,
endeavouring to help each other on occasion; No noise nor appearance of
distaste: and although sometimes cross Accidents would happen, which
might have set other Men together by the Ears, yet they were not moved
by them. Sometimes they will also drink freely, and warm themselves
with their Drink; yet neither then could I ever perceive them out of
Humour. They are not only thus civil among themselves, but very
obliging and kind to Strangers; nor were their Children rude to us, as
is usual. Indeed the Women, when we came to <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>their Houses, would modestly
beg any Rags, or small pieces of Cloth, to swaddle their young ones in,
holding out their Children to us; and begging is usual among all these
wild Nations. Yet neither did they beg so importunely as in other
Places; nor did the Men ever beg any thing at all. Neither, except once
at the first time we came to an Anchor (as I shall relate) did they
steal any thing; but dealt justly, and with great sincerity with us;
and made us very welcome to their Houses with <i>Bashee</i> drink. If
they had none of this Liquor themselves, they would buy a Jar of Drink
of their Neighbours, and sit down with us: for we could see them go and
give a piece or two of their Gold for some Jars of <i>Bashee</i>. And
indeed among Wild <i>Indians</i>, as these seem to be, I wonder&rsquo;d
to see buying and selling, which is not so usual; nor to converse so
freely, as to go aboard Stranger&rsquo;s Ships with so little caution:
Yet their own small Trading may have brought them to this. At these
entertainments they and their Family, Wife and Children drank out of
small Callabashes; and when by themselves, they drink about from one to
another; but when any of us came among them, they would always drink to
one of us.</p>

<p>They have no sort of Coin; but they have small Crumbs of the Metal
before described, which they bind up very safe in Plantain Leaves, or
the like. This Metal they exchange for what they want, giving a small
quantity of it, about 2 or 3 Grains, for a Jar of Drink, that would
hold 5 or 6 Gallons. They have no Scales, but give it by guess. Thus
much in general.</p>

<p>To proceed therefore with our Affairs, I have said before, that we
anchored here the 6th day of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108">108</a>]</span><i>August</i>. While we were furling our Sails,
there came near 100 Boats of the Natives aboard, with 3 or 4 Men in
each; so that our Deck was full of Men. We were at first afraid of
them, and therefore got up 20 or 30 small Arms on our Poop, and kept 3
or 4 Men as Centinels, with Guns in their Hands, ready to fire on them
if they had offered to molest us. But they were pretty quiet, only they
pickt up such old Iron that they found on our Deck, and they also took
out our Pump-Bolts, and Linch-Pins out of the Carriages of our Guns,
before we perceived them. At last, one of our Men perceived one of them
very busie getting out one of our Linch Pins; and took hold of the
fellow, who immediately bawl&rsquo;d out, and all the rest presently
leaped overboard, some into their Boats, others into the Sea; and they
all made away for the Shore. But when we perceived their Fright, we
made much of him that was in hold, who stood Trembling all the while;
and at last we gave him a small piece of Iron, with which he
immediately leapt overboard and swam to his Consorts; who hovered about
our Ship to see the Issue. Then we beckned to them to come aboard
again, being very loth to lose a Commerce with them. Some of the Boats
came aboard again, and they were always very Honest and Civil
afterward.</p>

<p>We presently after this sent a Canoa ashore, to see their manner of
living, and what Provision they had: The Canao&rsquo;s Crew were made
very welcome with Bashee drink, and saw abundance of Hogs, some of
which they bought, and returned aboard. After this the Natives brought
aboard both Hogs and Goats to us in their own Boats; and every day
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>we
should have 15 or 20 Hogs and Goats in Boats aboard by our side. These
we bought for a small matter; we could buy a good fat Goat for an old
Iron Hoop, and a Hog of 70 or 80 pound weight for 2 or 3 pound of Iron.
Their drink also they brought off in Jars, which we bought for old
Nails, Spikes, and Leaden Bullets. Besides the fore-mentioned
Commodities, they brought aboard great quantities of Yams and Potatoes;
which we purchased for Nails, Spikes, or Bullets. It was one
Man&rsquo;s work to be all day cutting out Bars of Iron into small
pieces with a cold Chisel: And these were for the great Purchases of
Hogs and Goats, which they would not sell for Nails, as their Drinks
and Roots. We never let them know what Store we have, that they may
value it the more. Every Morning, as soon as it was light, they would
thus come aboard with their Commodities; which we bought as we had
occasion. We did commonly furnish our selves with as many Goats and
Roots as served us all the day; and their Hogs we bought in large
Quantities, as we thought convenient; for we salted them. Their Hogs
were very sweet; but I never saw so many Meazled ones.</p>

<p>We filled all our Water at a curious Brook close by us in <i>
Grafton</i>&rsquo;s Isle, where we first anchored. We stayed there
about three or four days, before we went to other Islands. We sailed to
the Southward, passing on the East-side of <i>Grafton</i> Island, and
then passed thro&rsquo; between that and <i>Monmouth</i> Island; but we
found no Anchoring till we came to the North end of <i>Monmouth</i>
Island, and there we stopt during one Tide. The Tide runs very strong
here, and sometimes makes a short chopping Sea. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>Its course among these
Islands is S. by E. and N. by W. The Flood sets to the North, and Ebb
to the South, and it riseth and falleth 8 Foot.</p>

<p>When we went from hence, we coasted about 2 Leagues to the
Southward, on the West side of <i>Monmouth</i> Island; and finding no
Anchor-ground, we stood over to the <i>Bashee</i> Island, and came to
an Anchor on the North East part of it, against a small sandy Bay, in 7
fathom clean hard Sand, and about a quarter of a Mile from the Shore.
Here is a pretty wide Channel between these two Islands, and Anchoring
all over it. The Depth of Water is 2, 14, and 16 Fathom.</p>

<p>We presently built a Tent ashore, to mend our Sails in, and
stay&rsquo;d all the rest of our time here, <i>viz.</i> from the 13th
day of <i>August</i> till the 26th day of <i>September</i>. In which
time we mended our Sails, and scrubb&rsquo;d our Ships bottom very
well; and every day some of us went to their Towns, and were kindly
entertained by them. Their Boats also came aboard with their
Merchandize to sell, and lay aboard all Day; and if we did not take it
off their Hands one Day, they would bring the same again the next.</p>

<p>We had yet the Winds at S.W. and S.S.W. mostly fair Weather. In <i>
October</i> we did expect the Winds to shift to the N.E. and therefore
we provided to sail (as soon as the Eastern Monsoon was settled) to
cruize off at <i>Manila</i>. Accordingly we provided a stock of
Provision. We salted 70 or 80 good fat Hogs, and bought Yams and
Potatoes good store to eat at Sea.</p>

<p>About the 24th day of <i>September</i>, the Winds shifted about to
the East, and from thence to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>N.E. fine fair Weather. The 25th it came
at N. and began to grow fresh, and the Sky began to be clouded; and the
Wind freshened on us.</p>

<p>At 12 a clock at night it blew a very fierce Storm. We were then
riding with our best Bower<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3208src" href=
"#xd0e3208">27</a> a Head and though our Yards and Top-mast were down,
yet we drove. This obliged us to let go our Sheet-Anchor, veering out a
good scope of Cable, which stopt us till 10 or 11 a clock the next day.
Then the Wind came on so fierce, that she drove again, with both
Anchors a-head. The Wind was now at N. by W. and we kept driving till 3
or 4 a clock in the afternoon: and it was well for us that there were
no Islands, Rocks, or Sands in our way, for if there had, we must have
been driven upon them. We used our utmost endeavours to stop here,
being loath to go to Sea, because we had six of our Men ashore, who
could not get off now. At last we were driven off into deep Water, and
then it was in vain to wait any longer: Therefore we hove in our Sheet
Cable, and got up our Sheet Anchor, and cut away our best Bower, (for
to have heav&rsquo;d her up then would have gone near to have foundred
us) and so put to Sea. We had very violent Weather the night ensuing,
with very hard Rain, and we were forced to scud with our bare Poles
till 3 a Clock in the morning. Then the Wind slacken&rsquo;d, and we
brought our Ship to, under a mizen, and lay with our Head to the
Westward. The 27th day the Wind abated much, but it rained very hard
all day, and the Night ensuing. The 28th day the Wind came about to the
N.E. and it cleared up, and blew a hard Gale, but it stood not there,
for it shifted about to the Eastward, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>thence to the S.E. then to the
South, and at last settled at S.W. and then we had a moderate Gale and
fair Weather.</p>

<p>It was the 29th day when the Wind came to the S.W. Then we made all
the Sail we could for the Island again. The 30th day we had the Wind at
West, and saw the Islands; but could not get in before night. Therefore
we stood off to the Southward till two a Clock in the morning; then we
tackt, and stood in all the morning, and about 12 a clock, the 1st day
of <i>October</i>, we anchored again at the place from whence we were
driven.</p>

<p>Then our six men were brought aboard by the Natives, to whom we gave
3 whole Bars of Iron, for their kindness and civility, which was an
extraordinary to them. Mr. <i>Robert Hall</i> was one of the Men that
was left ashore. I shall speak more of him hereafter. He and the rest
of them told me, that after the Ship was out of sight, the Natives
began to be more kind to them than they had been before, and persuaded
them to cut their Hair short, as theirs was, offering to each of them
if they would do it, a young Woman to Wife, and a small Hatchet, and
other Iron Utensils, fit for a Planter, in Dowry; and withal shewed
them a piece of Land for them to manage. They were courted thus by
several of the Town where they then were: but they took up their head
quarters at the House of him with whom they first went ashore. When the
Ship appeared in sight again, then they importuned them for some Iron,
which is the chief thing that they covet, even above their Ear-rings.
We might have bought all their Ear-rings, or other Gold they had, with
our Iron-bars, had we been assured of its goodness; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>and yet when it
was touch&rsquo;d and compar&rsquo;d with other Gold, we could not
discern any difference, tho&rsquo; it look&rsquo;d so pale in the lump;
but the seeing them polish it so often, was a new discouragement.</p>

<p>This last Storm put our Men quite out of heart: for although it was
not altogether so fierce as that which we were in on the Coast of <i>
China</i>, which was still fresh in Memory, yet it wrought more
powerfully, and frighted them from their design of cruising before <i>
Manila</i>, fearing another Storm there. Now every Man wisht himself at
home, as they had done an hundred times before: But Captain <i>
Read</i>, and Captain <i>Teat</i> the Master, persuaded them to go
toward Cape <i>Comorin</i>, and then they would tell them more of their
Minds, intending doubtless to cruize in the <i>Red Sea</i>; and they
easily prevailed with the Crew.</p>

<p>The Eastern Monsoon was now at hand, and the best way had been to go
through the Streights of <i>Malacca</i>; but Captain <i>Teat</i> said
it was dangerous, by reason of many Islands and Shoals there, with
which none of us were acquainted. Therefore he thought it best to go
round on the East-side of all the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and so
keeping South toward the <i>Spice Islands</i>, to pass out into the <i>
East-Indian</i> Ocean about the Island <i>Timor</i>.</p>

<p>This seemed to be a very tedious way about, and as dangerous
altogether for Sholes; but not for meeting with <i>English</i> or <i>
Dutch</i> Ships, which was their greatest Fear. I was well enough
satisfied, knowing that the farther we went, the more Knowledge and
Experience I should get, which was the main Thing that I regarded; and
should also have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114">114</a>]</span>the more variety of Places to attempt an Escape
from them, being fully resolv&rsquo;d to take the first opportunity of
giving them the slip.</p>

<p>The third Day of <i>October 1687</i>, we sailed from these Islands,
standing to the Southward; intending to sail through among the Spice
Islands. We had fair Weather, and the Wind at West. We first
steer&rsquo;d S.S.W. and passed close by certain small Islands that lye
just by the North-end of the Island <i>Luconia</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e3348src" href="#xd0e3348">28</a> We left them all on the West
of us, and past on the East-side of it, and the rest of the <i>
Philippine</i> Islands, coasting to the Southward.</p>

<p>The N. East-end of the Island <i>Luconia</i> appears to be good
Champion Land, of an indifferent heighth, plain and even for many
Leagues; only it has some pretty high Hills standing upright by
themselves in these Plains; but no ridges of Hills, or chains of
Mountains joyning one to another. The Land on this side seems to be
most Savannah, or Pasture: The S.E. part is more Mountainous and
Woody.</p>

<p>Leaving the Island <i>Luconia</i>, and with it our Golden Projects,
we sailed on to the Southward, passing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>on the East-side of the rest of
the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. These appear to be more Mountainous, and
less Woody, till we came in sight of the Island St. <i>John</i>; the
first of that name I mentioned: the other I spake of on the Coast of
<i>China</i>. This I have already described to be a very woody Island.
Here the Wind coming Southerly, forced us to keep farther from the
Islands.</p>

<p>The 14 day of <i>October</i> we came close by a small low woody
Island, that lieth East from the S.E. end of <i>Mindanao</i>, distant
from it about 20 Leagues. I do not find it set down in any
Sea-Chart.</p>

<p>The 15th day we had the Wind at N.E. and we steered West for the
Island <i>Mindanao</i>, and arrived at the S.E. end again in the 16th
day. There we went in and anchored between two small Islands, which lie
in about 5 d. 10 m. North Lat. I mentioned them when we first came on
this Coast. Here we found a fine small Cove, on the N.W. end of the
<span class="corr" id="xd0e3391" title="Source: Eastermost">
Easternmost</span> Island [<i>i.e.</i>, Sarangani], fit to careen in,
or hale ashore; so we went in there, and presently unrigg&rsquo;d our
Ship, and provided to hale our Ship ashore, to clean her bottom. These
Islands are about 3 or 4 Leagues from the Island <i>Mindanao</i>; they
are about 4 or 5 Leagues in Circumference, and of a pretty good
heighth. The Mold is black and deep; and there are two small Brooks of
fresh Water.</p>

<p>They are both plentifully stored with great high Trees; therefore
our Carpenters were sent ashore to cut down some of them for our use;
for here they made a new Boltsprit, which we did set here also, our old
one being very faulty. They made a new Fore-yard too, and a
Fore-top-mast: And our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117">117</a>]</span>Pumps being faulty, and not serviceable, they
did cut a Tree to make a Pump. They first squared it, then sawed it in
the middle, and then hollowed each side exactly. The two hollow sides
were made big enough to contain a Pump-box in the midst of them both,
when they were joined together; and it required their utmost Skill to
close them exactly to the making a tight Cylinder for the Pump-box;
being unaccustomed to such work. We learnt this way of Pump-making from
the <i>Spaniards</i>; who make their Pumps that they use in their Ships
in the <i>South-Seas</i> after this manner; and I am confident that
there are no better Hand-pumps in the World than they have.</p>

<p>While we lay here, the young Prince that I mentioned in the 13th
Chapter, came aboard. He understanding that we were bound farther to
the Southward, desired us to transport him and his Men to his own
Island. He shewed it to us in our Draft, and told us the Name of it;
which we put down in our Draft, for it was not named there; but I quite
forgot to put it into my Journal.</p>

<p>This Man told us, that not above six days before this, he saw
Captain <i>Swan</i>, and several of his Men that we left there, and
named the Names of some of them, who, he said, were all well, and that
now they were at the City of <i>Mindanao</i>; but that they had all of
them been out with <i>Raja Laut</i>, fighting under him in his Wars
against his Enemies the <i>Alfoores</i>; and that most of them fought
with undaunted Courage; for which they were highly honoured and
esteemed, as well by the Sultan, as by the General <i>Raja Laut</i>;
that now Capt. <i>Swan</i> intended to go with his Men to Fort <i>St.
George</i>, and that in order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118"
href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>thereto, he had proffered forty Ounces of
Gold for a Ship; but the Owner and he were not yet agreed; and that he
feared that the Sultan would not let him go away till the Wars were
ended.</p>

<p>All this the Prince told us in the <i>Malayan</i> tongue, which many
of us had learnt; and when he went away he promised to return to us
again in 3 days time, and so long Captain <i>Read</i> promised to stay
for him (for we had now almost finished our Business) and he seemed
very glad of the opportunity of going with us.</p>

<p>After this I endeavoured to perswade our Men, to return with the
Ship to the River of <i>Mindanao</i>, and offer their Service again to
Captain <i>Swan</i>. I took an opportunity when they were filling of
Water, there being then half the Ships Company ashore; and I found all
these very willing to do it. I desired them to say nothing, till I had
tried the Minds of the other half, which I intended to do the next day;
it being their turn to fill Water then; But one of these Men, who
seemed most forward to invite back Captain <i>Swan</i>, told Captain
<i>Read</i> and Captain <i>Teat</i> of the Project, and they presently
disswaded the Men from any such Designs. Yet fearing the worst, they
made all possible haste to be gone.</p>

<p>I have since been informed, that Captain <i>Swan</i> and his Men
stayed there a great while afterward; and that many of the Men got
passage from thence in <i>Dutch</i> Sloops to <i>Ternate</i>,
particularly Mr. <i>Rofy</i>, and Mr. <i>Nelly</i>. There they remained
a great while, and at last got to <i>Batavia</i> (where the <i>
Dutch</i> took their Journals from them) and so to <i>Europe</i>; and
that some of Captain <i>Swan&rsquo;s</i> Men died at <i>Mindanao</i>;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>of
which number Mr. <i>Harthrope</i>, and Mr. <i>Smith</i>, Captain <i>
Swan</i>&rsquo;s Merchants were two. At last Captain <i>Swan</i> and
his Surgeon going in a small Canoa aboard of a <i>Dutch</i> Ship then
in the Road, in order to get Passage to <i>Europe</i>, were overset by
the Natives at the Mouth of the River; who waited their coming
purposely to do it, but unsuspected by them; where they both were
kill&rsquo;d in the Water. This was done by the General&rsquo;s Order,
as some think, to get his Gold, which he did immediately seize on.
Others say, it was because the General&rsquo;s House was burnt a little
before, and Captain <i>Swan</i> was suspected to be the Author of it;
and others say, That it was Captain <i>Swan</i>&rsquo;s Threats
occasioned his own Ruin; for he would often say passionately, that he
had been abused by the General, and that he would have satisfaction for
it; saying also, that now he was well acquainted with their Rivers, and
knew how to come in at any time; that he also knew their manner of
Fighting, and the Weakness of their Country; and therefore he would go
away, and get a Band of Men to assist him, and returning thither again,
he would spoil and take all that they had, and their Country too. When
the General had been informed of these Discourses, he would say, What,
is Captain <i>Swan</i> made of Iron, and able to resist a whole
Kingdom? Or does he think that we are afraid of him, that he speaks
thus? Yet did he never touch him, till now the <i>Mindanayans</i>
kill&rsquo;d him. It is very probable there might be somewhat of Truth
in all this; for the Captain was passionate, and the General greedy of
Gold. But whatever was the occasion, so he was killed, as several have
assured me, and his Gold seized on, and all <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb120" href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>his Things; and his Journal
also from <i>England</i>, as far as Cape <i>Corrientes</i> on the Coast
of <i>Mexico</i>. This Journal was afterwards sent away from thence by
Mr. <i>Moody</i> (who was there both a little before and a little after
the Murder) and he sent it to <i>England</i> by Mr. <i>Goddard</i>,
Chief Mate of the <i>Defence</i>.</p>

<p>But to our purpose: Seeing I could not persuade them to go to
Captain <i>Swan</i> again, I had a great desire to have had the
Prince&rsquo;s Company: But Captain <i>Read</i> was afraid to let his
fickle Crew lie long. That very day that the Prince had promised to
return to us, which was <i>November</i> 2, 1687<span class="corr" id=
"xd0e3560" title="Source: .">,</span> we sailed hence, directing our
course South-West, and having the Wind at N.W.</p>

<p>[The course of the ship after leaving Mindanao may be seen from the
heading to this chapter. Of Australia (or New Holland, as it was then
called) Dampier says: &ldquo;<i>New Holland</i> is a very large tract
of Land. It is not yet determined whether it is an Island or a main
Continent; but I am certain that it joyns neither to <i>Asia</i>, <i>
Africa</i>, nor <i>America</i>.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>[From Australia (chap. xvii) the adventurers sail along until they
reach Nicobar Island, where Dampier and two others receive permission
to remain, together with four Malays and a Portuguese; and have various
adventures with the natives of that island. Finally leaving there
(chap. xviii), they go to Sumatra, where the small band is decimated by
the death of one Malay and the Portuguese. The two Englishmen go to the
English factory. Leaving the island, Dampier sets out as boatswain of
an English ship for Nicobar, but returns to Achin. Thence he makes
various voyages (in 1688 and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121">121</a>]</span>1689) in Eastern waters, and finally becomes
gunner at the English factory at Bencouli (1690); but, that post
proving uncongenial, he deserts and takes passage for England (January
2, 1691). The journey to the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope
(chap. xix&mdash;misnumbered xx) witnesses a slight engagement between
the French, with whom hostilities have broken out, and the Dutch and
English; and the mysterious death of many of the sailors on the English
vessel, from the bad water, Dampier thinks. England is finally reached
(chap. xx), and the author&rsquo;s long voyage is over, September 16,
1691<span class="corr" id="xd0e3581" title="Not in source">.</span>]

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e1196src" id="xd0e1196">11</a></span> Dampier describes the
Acapulco ships and their route as follows (chapter ix): &ldquo;The
Ships that Trade hither are only three, two that constantly go once a
Year between this [<i>i.e.</i>, Acapulco] and <i>Manila</i> and <i>
Luconia</i>, one of the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, and one Ship more
every Year to and from <i>Lima</i>. This from <i>Lima</i> commonly
arrives a little before Christmas; she brings them Quick-silver, Cacao,
and Pieces of Eight. Here she stays till the <i>Manila</i> Ships
arrive, and then takes in a Cargo of Spices, Silks, Callicoes, and
Muslins, and other East-India Commodities, for the use of <i>Peru</i>,
and then returns to <i>Lima</i>. This is but a small Vessel of 20 Guns,
but the two <i>Manila</i> Ships are each said to be above 1000 Tun.
These make their Voyages alternately, so that one or other of them is
always at the <i>Manila</i>&rsquo;s. When either of them sets out from
<i>Acapulco</i>, it is at the latter end of <i>March</i>, or the
beginning of <i>April</i>; she always touches to refresh at <i>
Guam</i>, one of the <i>Ladrone</i> Islands, in about 60 Days space
after she sets out. There she stays but two or three Days, and then
prosecutes her Voyage to <i>Manila</i>, where she commonly arrives some
time in <i>June</i>. By that time the other is ready to sail from
thence, laden with <i>East-India</i> Commodities. She stretcheth away
to the North as far as 36, or sometimes into 40 degrees of North lat.
before she gets a Wind to stand over to the <i>American</i> shoar. She
falls in first with the Coast of <i>California</i>, and then Coasts
along the shoar to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e1261" href=
"#xd0e1261">52n</a>]</span>the South again, and never misses a Wind to
bring her away from thence quite to <i>Acapulco</i>. When she gets the
length of Cape <i>St. Lucas</i>, which is the <span class="corr" id=
"xd0e1269" title="Source: Southermost">Southernmost</span> point of <i>
California</i>, she stretcheth over to Cape <i>Corientes</i>, which is
in about the 20th degree of North lat. from thence she Coasts along
till she comes to <i>Sallagua</i>, and there she sets ashoar Passengers
that are bound to the City of <i>Mexico</i>. From thence she makes her
best way, Coasting still along shoar, till she arrives at <i>
Acapulco</i>, which is commonly about Christmas, never more than 8 or
10 days before or after. Upon the return of this Ship to <i>Manila</i>,
the other which stayeth there till her arrival, takes her turn back to
<i>Acapulco</i>. Sir <i>John Narborough</i> therefore was imposed on by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, who told him that there were 8 Sail, or more,
that used this Trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=

&ldquo;Islands of the Tortoise&rdquo;) belong to the government of
Ecuador, and are located seven hundred and thirty miles west of that
country in the Pacific. They consist of six principal and seven smaller
islands. The largest is Albemarle. They are all volcanic. Of them
Dampier says (chapter v): &ldquo;The <i>Gallapagos</i> Islands are a
great Number of uninhabited Islands, lying under, and on both sides of
the Equator. The Eastermost of them are about 110 Leagues from the
Main. They are laid down in the Longitude of 181, reaching to the
Westward as far as 176, therefore their Longitude from <i>England</i>
Westward is about 68 degrees. But I believe our Hydrographers do not
place them far enough to the Westward. The <i>Spaniards</i> who first
discovered them, and in whose draught alone they are laid down, report
them to be a great number, stretching North-West from the Line, as far
as 5 degrees N. but we saw not above 14 or 15. They are some of them 7
or 8 leagues long and 3 or 4 broad. They are of a good heighth, most of
them flat or even on the top; 4 or 5 of the Eastermost are rocky,
barren and hilly, producing neither Tree, Herb, nor Grass, but a few
Dildo-trees, except by the Sea side.&rdquo;</p>

which they maintained for eighty years. In 1683 the Dutch sent a
considerable force from Batavia and expelled the English from Bantam;
the latter, after being baffled at Achin, made a settlement at
Bencoolen (1685), where they built Fort York. This site proved
insalubrious, and in 1714 its successor, Fort Marlborough, was erected,
away from the river. In 1824, Bencoolen and the factories dependent on
it were given over to the Dutch, in exchange for Malacca and some
factories in India. (Crawfurd&rsquo;s <i>Dict. Ind. Islands</i>, p.
48). Sellebar was a village not far east from Bencoolen.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e2954src" id="xd0e2954">25</a></span> The Bashee or Bachi Islands
form the northern cluster of the northern group of islands, called
Batanes, which lie north of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2956"
href="#xd0e2956">97n</a>]</span>Luz&oacute;n. They are the most
northern of all the American possessions in the Orient, and are
separated from Formosa by the strait of Bachi. The islands composing
the cluster are Mabudis, Misanga, Siayan, Tanan, and Y&rsquo;Ami (all
inhabited), the last being the most northern. The Batanes are composed
in all of ten named islands and forty unnamed islets and rocks, the
southern cluster including Bachi Rocks; Bat&aacute;n, the central and
most important island of the group; D&eacute;quez; Diamis Rocks; Diego;
Ibayat (or Isbayat), the largest of these islands; Ibugos; North; and
Sabt&aacute;n. The name of Bachi is sometimes extended to the entire
group, and it is probable that Dampier&rsquo;s five islands, or at
least some of them, were among the southern cluster; for D&eacute;quez
Island is also called Goat; Ibayat, Orange; and Ibugos, Bachi. The
group is separated on the south from the Babuyanes by the
Balingt&aacute;n Channel. The larger islands bear indications of a late
volcanic origin; the smaller islands are generally low, and rest upon
foundations of coral. In this group are a number of good harbors; but
communication between the islands is difficult because of the strong
currents in the channels and the scarcity of anchorages. The exports of
the islands consist of lard, cocoanut oil, hogs, horses, goats, and
some valuable woods. The soil is fertile, especially of Bat&aacute;n,
and many vegetables are produced. Some of the products of the United
States can be successfully raised. The chief industry is the raising of
cattle, hogs, goats, and horses, the last being of superior quality and
in demand. A catechism of the dialect spoken in the Batanes was
published by a friar in 1834, an examination of which has led Dr. Pardo
de Tavera to the conclusion that the aboriginal tongue differed
considerably from the other Filipino dialects, as it contains the sound
&ldquo;tsch&rdquo; and a nasal sound like the French &ldquo;en.&rdquo;
It is probable, however, that the present population of the Batanes, as
well as of the Babuyanes, is composed very largely of Ib&aacute;nag
from the Cagay&aacute;n Valley (Luz&oacute;n), introduced there as
colonists by the Dominican friars. This population is Christian. The
earlier population must have borne considerable resemblance to the
natives of Formosa. See <i>Gazetteer of Philippine Islands</i>, and <i>
Census of the Philippines</i>, i, pp. 264, 448.</p>

<h2 class="normal">Petition for Dominican Missionaries</h2>

<p>Fray Francisco de Villalva of the Order of Preachers, and
procurator-general (in virtue of powers which he presents) of the
province of Santo Rosario, which the said order has in the Filipinas
Islands, declares: That, as is well known, the religious of his order
in the said islands have converted to the Catholic faith, and now have
in their charge, the provinces of Cagayan, Pangasinan, Mandayas, part
of Tagalos, Zambales, and the island of Babuyanes&mdash;in which
territory there is diversity of languages, and a great number of
convents provided with ministers for the instruction of the Indian
natives; from this labor always has been and still is gathered the
spiritual harvest which is well known. Moreover, those fathers have
made extensive conquests in various parts of those kingdoms, founding
many churches&mdash;as they actually are maintaining public worship at
this very time in the vast empire of Great China. There they are
suffering immense hardships and persecutions, shedding their blood in
the violent acts committed by tyranny, in order to plant there the
Christian faith and religion; for this cause, and in its defense,
seventy-eight religious have given their lives as martyrs in that
province, leaving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123">123</a>]</span>the church made illustrious by this triumph.
And besides this, they have in the city of Manila their principal
convent, which continually maintains the practices of hearing
confessions, preaching, and giving consolation in the sicknesses and
trials of the citizens, with great comfort to all. They have also the
college of Santo Tom&agrave;s, in which are taught grammar, the arts,
and scholastic and moral theology, to the benefit of all that community
and the entire archipelago. They support students holding fellowships,
usually twenty-four to thirty, without receiving any stipend: and have
thus sent out, as they are still doing, graduates of much learning, for
the dignities and curacies of those islands. They have also another
college, that of San Juan de Letran, with more than a hundred orphan
boys, the sons of poor soldiers who have died in the service of your
Majesty&mdash;giving them all that is necessary for their support, and
instructing them in reading, writing, religious conduct, and virtue;
while those boys who are not inclined to study are aided in obtaining
positions as soldiers, artillerists, mariners, and in other occupations
in which they are employed to the service of your Majesty. Another
enterprise is also at the expense and charge of the said religious
order and province&mdash;the Parian, which is the silk-market of the
Chinese; it is close to the walls of Manila, and from five to six
thousand Chinamen usually reside in it. For the Christians preaching in
their own language is furnished every feast-day in their own church,
and there is continual preaching to the heathen through the streets;
with this labor they have made a great many conversions, and gained an
enormous number of souls. For this same nation <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>those fathers maintain a
hospital, in which, with the good example of those religious, and their
instruction and continual assistance in the sicknesses of the Chinese,
they have gained so great a harvest that from its foundation (which was
in the former year of 1588) to the present year of 1677,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e3594src" href="#xd0e3594">1</a> seldom has a patient
died without receiving the water of holy baptism. This religious order
also have at San Juan del Monte a sanctuary which is the object of
devotion of all that colony; and at the port of Cavite, three leguas
distant from Manila&mdash;where the galleons and other vessels of
smaller size are built&mdash;they have the convent of San Thelmo, the
religious of which assist the soldiers, mariners, and sailors with
their preaching and instruction, so that all of them may live Christian
and orderly lives.</p>

<p>This religious province administers the functions entrusted to it
without any worldly advantage, receiving neither imposts nor fees for
burials, marriages, feast-days, or sermons&mdash;its religious being
supported only by the stipend which your Majesty assigns to the
ministers in the mission villages; and from this amount they spend much
and distribute [alms] among the poor and needy Indians of their
districts. Nor is there in any convent of the said province any fixed
income; nor has the province ever accepted deposits or valuable
articles, or permitted its individual religious to keep these things in
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125">125</a>]</span>cells, or anything except a breviary and the
holy Bible, for the preaching of the holy gospel. Their clothing is of
coarse, rough frieze without, and their inner garments of what your
Majesty (whom may God guard) grants them as alms. All this is evident
by the publicity of the facts, and by official information which on
various occasions has been sent to the glorious Catholic sovereigns,
your Majesty&rsquo;s predecessors, and to their royal and supreme
Council of the Indias by the governor and royal Audiencia of the
islands, and the cabildos, ecclesiastical and secular, of the said city
of Manila.</p>

<p>In consideration of these things, and of the fact that so numerous
Christian communities are persevering in the Catholic faith, and that
these are spreading with the new conversions, his Majesty who is now in
glory, moved by the fervent zeal which he always had for the good of
souls, continued to send to the said islands religious of the Order of
St. Dominic, in order that by their apostolic lives and doctrine they
might teach and preach the holy gospel. And finally, in the past year
of 1668 her Highness the queen-regent, the mother of your Majesty, was
pleased to grant permission that some of those religious should go
thither at the cost of the royal treasury; in accordance with this
thirty-three religious went to those islands, thirty priests and three
lay brethren.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3609src" href="#xd0e3609">2</a>
But, although that permission and the number of missionaries were
enough for one shipment, they do not suffice for the succor of so many
souls as that province has in its charge, and for the new conversions
which continually present themselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>Moreover, with the long voyage,
the unaccustomed climates, the continual toil, and the austerity which
is observed by this province&mdash;which follows the primitive rule of
its order&mdash;the number of its members must necessarily diminish.
This has actually been the case, since from the time when permission
was given for the last shipload of religious, which was nine years ago,
a greater number have died than those who went to the islands in that
band, as was evident from the last reports which the said province sent
[to Espa&ntilde;a], and which the petitioner will exhibit, if
necessary. And today, counting in the sick, crippled, and old men,
there are not ninety priests in the said province; and even though
there were many more, since more are actually necessary it is highly
expedient that other and fresh religious should go thither, that they
may be rendering themselves capable in the languages and ministries, so
that ready and intelligent laborers may never be lacking for the
instruction and teaching of the natives, and for the new conversions,
which our sovereigns the Catholic kings of Espa&ntilde;a have so
earnestly striven to maintain and increase, sending religious every
four or six years, and sometimes every two years; without the
ministries being less than they are now, nor do fewer die now than
then.</p>

<p>In order to provide those who should go, and to find the number for
whom your Majesty shall be pleased to grant permission, to obtain
information about them, to examine into their virtue and learning, and
to secure a judicious choice, the petitioner needs about a year, in
which time he can go personally to the convents of the three provinces
of Espa&ntilde;a; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127">127</a>]</span>the importance of so delicate a matter will not
permit that it be entrusted to letters alone. Accordingly, he should
have at least the time until St. John&rsquo;s day next, or when the
first fleet shall be equipped; otherwise he cannot sail from
Espa&ntilde;a and make a voyage to Filipinas with religious. To reach
those islands, two years are usually required, and at the very least
more than one year; and by that time eleven or twelve years will have
passed since the last permission [of that sort]. In that protracted
course of time, there must necessarily have occurred many deaths among
the laborers who work in that vineyard&mdash;of whose labor and
conversion of souls God has made watch-towers for our sovereigns the
Catholic kings of Espa&ntilde;a, and for their royal and supreme
Council of the Indias, upon whom is laid this heavy weight of
obligation&mdash;in fulfilling which they have always made every
exertion, giving permissions, orders, means, and aid to the ministers
who have gone thither to cultivate that field.</p>

<p>Therefore the said province, and the said Fray Francisco de Villalva
in its name, have recourse to the kindness and fervent zeal of your
Majesty, with which you have always striven for the preservation and
propagation of the Catholic faith; and prostrate at your royal feet he
entreats that your Majesty will be pleased to take pity on so many
souls and the conversions for which the religious of St. Dominic are
caring and in which they are laboring in the said Filipinas Islands.
They ask that you will grant to the said province forty religious,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e3623src" href="#xd0e3623">3</a> and a suitable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128">128</a>]</span>number of lay brethren; and to the petitioner
permission to conduct them thither in his company, and the necessary
supplies for him and them, so that on the first opportunity when there
is a fleet they may embark for their voyage. In this, God our Lord will
regard himself as well served; and that poor and remote province will
be anew constrained, in return for this favor and grace, to continue
its prayers and sacrifices for the life and health of your Majesty, and
for the welfare and increase of your entire monarchy. <span class=

<h2 class="normal">Events in Filipinas, 1686&ndash;88</h2>

<p><i>Diary of new events in Filipinas, from June, 1686 to June in
87</i></p>

<p>On June 11, 1686, the galleon &ldquo;Santo Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo;
discovered, twenty-two leguas from the island of San Juan, a new
island, larger than any of those discovered in Marianas; it is named
San Bernab&eacute;, because it was discovered on the day of that
saint.</p>

<p>On July 11 the bells were rung in Manila for the arrival of the
galleon &ldquo;Santa Rosa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the twelfth they hanged five Sangleys, who were found guilty in
the mutiny.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth news came that all the people who were in the
lancha that lost its course in Marianas had safely reached port in
Cagayan.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth the courier<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3649src"
href="#xd0e3649">1</a> arrived with the mail.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth the auditor Don Diego Calderon died.</p>

<p>On the second of August, Licentiate Don Rafael Tome, a student in
San Jos&eacute;, died.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh, the sloop for Marianas sailed from Cavite;
and Fathers Diego de Zarzosa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132">132</a>]</span>and Jacinto Garcia,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e3666src" href="#xd0e3666">2</a> and Brother Melchor de los Reyes,
embarked in it.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth, our mail reached Manila. On the twenty-eighth,
that from Roma was opened, and no [provision for our] government was
found.</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, the Augustinians brought suit against
us before the archbishop, regarding the administration of
Mariquina.</p>

<p>On the sixth of October, Father Jose Lopez died in Palapag.</p>

<p>On the twelfth the father provincial, Francisco Salgado,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e3677src" href="#xd0e3677">3</a> and the father
rector, Luis Pimentel,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3680src" href=
"#xd0e3680">4</a> were notified of the judicial decision by the
archbishop&mdash;who, declaring himself to be a competent judge,
notwithstanding [our] challenge of his cognizance, although he had
approved our licenses and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133">133</a>]</span>our administration of the sacraments, revoked
the said licenses, and decreed that no one of the Society should
minister in Mariquina,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3685src" href=
"#xd0e3685">5</a> and that the ministry there should devolve upon the
Augustinians.</p>

<p>On the same day, the twelfth of October, it was decided in a
provincial council that the paths of government should be opened. The
first was entered by Father Geronimo de Ortega, and the second by
Father Juan Andres de Palavicino; but, on account of the death of both
these, Father Luis Pimentel&mdash;at the time, rector of the college of
San Ignacio&mdash;began to govern.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth of October, the armada entered the port of Cavite.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134">134</a>]</span></p>

<p>On the fifteenth, Father Antonio Jaramillo<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e3703src" href="#xd0e3703">6</a> began to officiate as rector of
the college of Manila.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of October, a decree was made known to the
provisor, who had gone to Mariquina and Pasig, forbidding any official
whatever of the archbishopric from taking action in matters pertaining
to the lawsuit of Mariquina.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first, a decree was made known to the archbishop
strictly charging him that he must refrain from taking action in the
lawsuit of Mariquina, and that he must exhibit the records.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of December, the archbishop was notified and
charged not to disturb us in the Mariquina affair. On the nineteenth, a
similar charge was laid upon the prior of Pasig; and another, on the
twentieth, on the prior-general of the Augustinians. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>

<p>On the same day, the twentieth of December, the archbishop sent a
denunciation of excommunication, with the curse of God&mdash;Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit&mdash;and his own, and that of the apostles Peter
and Paul, to the governor and to Auditor Bolivar, in order that they
should not interfere in the Mariquina affair.</p>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">Year of 1687</h3>

<p>On the twenty-first of January, 1687, General Don Juan de Zalaeta
was arrested by order of the governor, and thrust into the sulphur
dungeon [<i lang="es">calabozo de azufre</i>]. <i>Item</i>, they also
arrested Licentiate Don Miguel de Lozama, and conveyed him, wearing two
pairs of fetters, to the fort of San Gabriel. The goods of both were
seized, and several of their clerks arrested.</p>

<p>On the twenty-second, Do&ntilde;a Ynes, the wife of the said Don
Miguel, sent a petition to the said governor, who answered that the
judge of the suit was Don Francisco Velasco, alcalde-in-ordinary.
Do&ntilde;a Ynes came before the royal Audiencia, and that body passed
an act providing that the said alcalde should, after taking the
confession of the accused, present the documents within twenty-four
hours. The governor, having seen this decree, issued another,
prohibiting further action by the royal Audiencia, and ordering the
alcalde to prosecute the case without surrendering the documents. At
night the governor summoned the auditors and fiscal to a conference,
and made an address to them&mdash;from which resulted, as was noticed,
great fear in the auditors, who almost decided to forsake the
Audiencia, and take refuge in sanctuary. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span></p>

<p>On the seventh of February, they arrested the auditor Don Diego de
Viga, put him on a vessel, and conveyed him to the island of Mariveles.
At the same time they made the most careful search, in order to seize
the auditor Don Pedro de Bolivar; but by that time he had fled to
sanctuary.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of February, they took from his house, where she
had remained with guards, Do&ntilde;a Josefa Moran de la Cueva, the
wife of the auditor Don Pedro de Bolivar, and carried her into
banishment at Abucay.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth, they also seized Do&ntilde;a Ynes, sister of the
said Do&ntilde;a Josefa, and wife of Licentiate Don Miguel de Lezama,
and carried her to the same place, Abucay.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth of February, the college of the Society of Jesus
was surrounded [by soldiers], to remove thence the person of the
auditor Don Pedro de Bolivar; and not finding him, the men remained on
guard, both within and without the college, for the space of nine days.
In that time they searched the house eleven times&mdash;four of these
with violence, wrenching the locks from doors, and breaking open
tables; but they did not find the said Don Pedro. At the end of the
nine days, he showed himself, of his own accord, and they arrested him
and took him to Mariveles; several days before they had removed from
the said island the auditor Don Diego de Viga, and transferred him to
that of Lucban.</p>

<p>Just about this time a new Audiencia was formed, which was thus
arranged: the governor was its president; the royal fiscal became an
auditor, Captain Don Jose Cervantes was judge of Audiencia, and Captain
Juan de Agulo attorney-general. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137">137</a>]</span></p>

<p>On the fourth of March&mdash;the day on which [the college of] the
Society was first searched with violence&mdash;the English pirate
captured a sloop of the king&rsquo;s, which was coming from Pangasinan
laden with three thousand cabans of cleaned rice. <i>Item</i>, he also
captured a champan belonging to the alcalde of Pangasinan, which came
laden with rice and other products.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3748src"
href="#xd0e3748">7</a></p>

<p>On the same day, the fourth of March, the archbishop sent to
Mariquina to investigate whether Father Diego de Ayala was officiating
as cura; the latter prevented the notary from doing so, and, when other
people went to make the said investigation, he told them that they need
not take that trouble&mdash;that he was acting as cura in virtue of the
bull of St. Pius V and of his assignment [to that parish] by the
[royal] patron.</p>

<p>On the fifth of March there was preaching in the royal chapel by a
Recollect friar, against whom the governor issued a royal decree very
sharply rebuking him, which he caused to be read to all the religious
orders. A few days later, the archbishop sent an act to the prior of
Pasig, ordering him to officiate as cura to the people of Cainta.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e3761src" href="#xd0e3761">8</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138">138</a>]</span></p>

<p>About Christmas, the royal magazines in Panay were burned, and in
them some six thousand cabans of rice. On the first of March, Saturday,
the Augustinians set fire to the cottage on the ranch which the college
of the Society of Jesus at Yloilo owns in Suaraga. On the following
Saturday, March 8, fire visited the Augustinians, destroying a visita,
a church and convent, and more than forty houses in the village. <i>
Item</i>, and the following Saturday, March 15, the church and house
were burned in the village of Dumangas, without their being able to
save their valuables, or to prevent the burning of the pious offerings
[<i lang="es">colectas</i>] of Cebu, which had been stored [in that
convent]; and, besides this, more than two thousand cabans of rice.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth of March, Passion Sunday, while Father Diego de
Ayala was saying mass in the village, the church was entered by armed
men, with Bachelor Teodoro de Aldana, the notary of the archbishop;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>the
prior of Pasig, with two laymen; and other people. After mass was
ended, they read to the Indians an act by the archbishop, which
commanded them, under penalty of flogging and the galleys, to appear
within three days before the prior of Pasig, resorting to the latter
for religious ministrations, and to repeat the sacraments.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth of March, the father procurator, Antonio de
Borja,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3790src" href="#xd0e3790">9</a>
presented a petition to the governor that he, as vice-patron, should
take measures regarding the violent spoliation which the archbishop had
inflicted on the Society. The governor referred the petition to the
royal fiscal, as being his Lordship&rsquo;s counselor, but the said
fiscal excused himself. Then it was referred to Doctor Cervantes, to
Fray Francisco de Santa Ynes, and to many other persons, both
ecclesiastics and laymen, but all excused themselves; and in these
proceedings much time passed, so that it was the end of May before
anything was accomplished.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth of March, in the afternoon, the secretary came to
deliver in behalf of the royal court a verbal message to the father
procurator [sic] Antonio Jaramillo, advising him of the oversight of
the preacher, who that morning in the sermon&mdash;at which the
governor and the king&rsquo;s fiscal were present&mdash;had omitted to
use the phrase, &ldquo;very potent sir.&rdquo; The same message was
sent to the superiors of the other religious orders, because, several
days before, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140">140</a>]</span>the prior of St. Augustine and another
religious, a Dominican, had fallen into the same offense, when
preaching in the royal chapel.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh of March, Holy Thursday, the monument<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e3799src" href="#xd0e3799">10</a> of the
Tag&aacute;logs in the church of Santo Domingo was burned. On the
twenty-eighth, Good Friday, there was a fire in Binondo and part of
Tondo; and one thousand two hundred and sixty houses were
destroyed&mdash;two hundred and fifty-eight in the village of Tondo,
and one thousand and two in that of Binondo. Thirteen persons were
burned to death, and many others escaped only with serious injuries.
The fire caught three times in the church of Binondo, but the Indians
of San Miguel and Dilao put it out.</p>

<p>On the twelfth of April the archbishop demanded aid from the
governor, and with it arrested the cantor Don Geronimo de Herrera, and
placed him in the fort of Santiago. Soon afterward, the governor caused
the arrest of Don Juan de Cordoba and one Carcano, respectively
procurator and receptor in the royal Audiencia; and afterward, on the
twentieth of April, of Blas de Armenta, secretary of the court, and of
Captain Diego de Vargas and others.</p>

<p>On the twenty-second of April Father Ferragut died in the
college.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of April, Domingo Diaz came to give the father
rector, Antonio Jaramillo, a copy of a petition by the Augustinians;
the father rector, before he knew that the said Domingo Diaz had come,
had made, <i lang="la">in scriptis</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, in writing], his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141">141</a>]</span>protest of incompetency of the judge, and of
challenge and appeal.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third of April, the father procurator, Antonio de
Borja, sent to the archbishop a document in which was set forth in due
form the said protest, challenge, and appeal. He also presented to the
governor a petition that he would give proper attention to the
disturbance which the Society had suffered, and the injury inflicted on
the royal patronage.</p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth of April, Domingo Diaz came again to give
Father Borja a copy of another petition from the Augustinians, who said
that the challenge and appeal which he had interposed were of no
force.</p>

<p>On the fourth of May, they brought Captain Mateo Perea under arrest
from the Lake [of Bay], and left him in his own house with guards. On
the sixth of May, Domingo Diaz came to make known to Father Borja an
act of the archbishop&mdash;who declaring that there was no occasion
for the challenge and appeal interposed, commanded that the parties
should make their complaint; and that within six days the documents for
the sentence should be brought to his illustrious Lordship. On the
tenth of May, Father Antonio Borja presented before the royal Audiencia
a plea of fuerza, in order that he might make known the injury which
the archbishop had done to the Society and the royal patronage.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of May, Domingo Diaz came to summon for the
sentence of the archbishop the father rector, Pedro de Oriol,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e3824src" href="#xd0e3824">11</a> who replied that he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>did
not regard himself as summoned, or acknowledge his illustrious Lordship
as a competent judge. On the same day, the fourteenth, Licentiate Don
Antonio Roberto was brought a prisoner from Marinduque; and they placed
him in the provisor&rsquo;s house, with a pair of very heavy
fetters.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of May, the father rector, Pedro de Oriol,
presented a petition to the governor, asking him to issue a juridical
testimony of his recourse [to the Audiencia] with a plea of fuerza; and
that notification be sent to the archbishop that his illustrious
Lordship must not take any further action until the royal court should
decide what must be done.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth of May, Domingo Diaz came to make known the
sentence of the archbishop, which declared that the Augustinians were
the lawful parish priests of Mariquina, and that the sacraments
administered by the fathers of the Society since October 12, 1686, had
no force. The reply to all was, [that such proceeding was] null, and
contrary to law. On the nineteenth of May, Father Borja came before the
royal court a second time with a plea of fuerza. On the twentieth of
May, the royal court resolved to issue a royal decree to the
archbishop, commanding him to deliver up the documents in the Mariquina
lawsuit.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third of May, they arrested the dean, Don Miguel Ortiz
de Cobarrubias, by order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143">143</a>]</span>of the archbishop; they placed him in the
provisor&rsquo;s house, and seized his goods. At the end of May, they
carried the two auditors, and soon afterward Don Juan de Zalaeta and
Don Miguel de Lezama, to Cagayan, as exiles; and they were placed one
in each of the four garrisons that are maintained in the said
province.</p>

<p>On the third of June, a notary came from the archbishop with a
petition from the Augustinians, who were asking his illustrious
Lordship to confirm the sentence that he had pronounced. Father Borja
made a reply, more than two sheets in length.</p>

<p>On the fifth of June, a royal decree was made known to the
archbishop that he must exhibit the documents in the Mariquina lawsuit,
and his illustrious Lordship said that he would reply and would send
the papers&mdash;which were in regard to the value of the
sacraments.</p>

<p>On the eighth of June the archbishop held a consultation with the
royal Audiencia, asking its aid to arrest and punish Fathers Diego de
Ayala and Pedro Cano.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3845src" href=
"#xd0e3845">12</a> Up to today, June 24, the archbishop has not
exhibited the documents in the Mariquina lawsuit.</p>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">News of this year of 1688 and part of the last one,
with an appendix of other points</h3>

<p>1. The ship &ldquo;Santo Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; which sailed from Cavite
last year, 1687, put back to the port of Bagatao, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>to the grief of
everyone&mdash;not only on account of the deterioration of property and
the very considerable damages, but also this greatly delayed the remedy
which is needed by the public calamities and the oppression under which
this colony lies. The ship&rsquo;s return to port is attributed to the
excessive lading which it carried, to careless arrangements and lack of
proper outfit, and to the undue timidity of those who had charge of the
vessel.</p>

<p>2. The Recollect fathers made a raid through the lands of Silang,
which they call Alipaopao, Oyaye, Malinta, etc.; and, trying to adjudge
them to the ranch of Sarmiento, which they had recently bought through
the agency of General Endaya, they committed unheard-of atrocities in
the houses and grain-fields of the Indians&mdash;burning and ravaging
them as furiously and horribly as if an army of Camucones had raided
them. The Indians lost, as appears from a juridical statement that was
drawn up, more than three thousand pesos.</p>

<p>3. A Dominican friar in Cagayan refused to absolve a Spaniard at the
hour of death, in spite of all his entreaties for absolution. Although
the friar had begun to hear his confession, the dying man could not
proceed with it, being stopped by the nausea which comes at death, and
he therefore died without absolution. I do not know all the
circumstances in this case.</p>

<p>4. Another friar in the same province refused to absolve Auditor Don
Diego de Viga, unless he would first express I know not what
protestations and detestations. The auditor replied that, for what
concerned the banishment of the archbishop, his conscience had not
given him any uneasiness, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>he had understood that he acted in regard
to it in accordance with the laws and decrees of our king a sovereign
so Catholic as is that of Espa&ntilde;a; and that in affairs in which
he had felt scruples, and had proceeded according to human judgment,
there was nothing for which to employ the friar&rsquo;s zeal, and still
less occasion for his trying to have him make those detestations and
protestations. Nevertheless, the friar persisted [<i lang="es">se
estuv&oacute; en sus trece</i>] in refusing to absolve him; and Don
Diego, embracing the holy Christ and uttering fervent acts of
contrition, said that he appealed to the mercy of God, and thus he
died. He was buried in consecrated ground, although afterward, it is
reported, the archbishop sent orders that his bones should be
disinterred, and removed from consecrated ground.</p>

<p>5. Do&ntilde;a Josefa de la Cerda, the wife of Auditor Bolivar,
died<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3868src" href="#xd0e3868">13</a> in her
exile, from anxiety and grief and despair. She asked for a confessor
from the Society, which was not granted to her. The Dominican friar who
served as parish priest in the village where she was an exile refused
to absolve her unless she would comply with certain conditions, with
which those fathers are wont to fetter and hinder souls. She was not
minded to comply with these, or to make her confession to a religious
of that order; and while a Franciscan who had been granted to her was
on his way, she died. They spread the report that she had died
impenitent, and buried her on the seashore.</p>

<p>6. The archbishop, since he came back from his exile, has not ceased
to wage war on this city. He demanded aid for arresting the religious
of the seraphic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146">146</a>]</span>father St. Francis, who preached in favor of
the royal patronage; <i>item</i>, for arresting those who were
ministering in Mariquina, the fathers of the Society; <i>item</i>, for
seizing Father Cano; and all these acts proceed from the fury and
partiality of Father Verart.</p>

<p>7. The bishop of Sinopolis died, and orders were given that he be
buried in [the church of] the Society of Jesus. This the archbishop and
his friars took so ill that the latter refused to go to his funeral and
burial, to the surprise and scandal of the whole city; and the
archbishop prevented the cabildo from paying the last honors to the
bishop in the church of the said order, declaring that it was polluted
by [containing] the remains of Se&ntilde;or Grimaldos, who in the
opinion of the said fathers died excommunicate.</p>

<p>8. The archbishop forcibly took from the fathers of the Society the
administration of the village of Cainta and Jesus de la Pe&ntilde;a,
and gave it to the Augustinian fathers&mdash;thus revenging himself on
those of the Society, whom he regarded as enemies; and for this cause
he commanded them to tear down their buildings at Jesus de la
Pe&ntilde;a, to the foundations&mdash;the governor aiding him in this
atrocious act, contrary to the laws and privileges of the royal
patronage.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e3685src" id="xd0e3685">5</a></span> On account of a ranch which
the college of San Ignacio at Manila possesses in the land of Meybonga,
not far from the said city&mdash;its name being Jesus de la
Pe&ntilde;a, or Mariquina&mdash;the Society began to administer the
sacraments, establishing the mission village of Mariquina, or Jesus de
la Pe&ntilde;a, by authority from Don Fray Pedro de Arce, bishop of
Zeb&ugrave; and apostolic ruler of the archbishopric of Manila, on
April 16, 1630; this was confirmed by the vice-patron, Don Juan
Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora, governor of these islands, on April 22, 1630.
The said village was cared for by the minister stationed in Santa Cruz,
or by a father sent by the rector of the college of Manila, who was the
director of the said village; for this no stipend was asked from his
Majesty, because the minister was not permanently established there,
and therefore the said college maintained him, without suspending, for
lack of a stipend, the ministry in the said village. In the year 1675,
the Society was confirmed in this administration by a royal decree,
dated July 26, on account of the Society&rsquo;s right to the said
parish having been disputed by the religious of St. Augustine, from
November, 1669. In 1681, the number of parishioners having increased,
it was judged necessary to station a permanent minister there, for the
better administration of the sacraments, and to build a house and a
larger church; and, as it was thus necessary to incur larger expenses,
the Society asked, in 1685, that to this minister be given the stipend
which his Majesty assigns to the parish priests, in accordance with the
number of tributes. The fiscal of his Majesty replied that in view of
what the Society was accomplishing there, a suitable stipend should be
given. In the year 1686, the religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd0e3687" href="#xd0e3687">134n</a>]</span>of St. Augustine claimed
that that Indian village belonged to them, as an annex to the ministry
of Pasig. The archbishop issued an act, on October 11, 1686, in which,
while admitting as valid the sacraments administered by the Society, he
took from all its religious permission to minister in Jesus de la
Pe&ntilde;a; and on March 10, 1687, he declared that the lawful parish
priest of the mission of Jesus de la Pe&ntilde;a was the prior of
Pasig, a religious of St. Augustine. In this spoliation concurred also,
through complaisance, the governor Don Gabriel Curuzelaegui, who on
March 23 of the said year decreed that Don Juan Pimentel, alcalde of
Tondo, should begin proceedings against the Society in the mission of
Jesus de la Pe&ntilde;a, as the king commanded; and that he should
assist the provisor in tearing down our church&mdash;which he did,
commanding the Indians to demolish that temple. <span class="corr" id=

born at Zafra February 23, 1648, and became a Jesuit novice at the age
of seventeen. He was sent to the Marianas Islands in 1678, and spent
sixteen years in missionary labors. While rector at Manila he was sent
to Spain as procurator; and he died at Oca&ntilde;a, on December 30,
1707. (Sommervogel, <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Comp. J&eacute;sus</i>,

Philippines, as that vessel was, at the time here mentioned, cruising
off the coast of Luz&oacute;n (see his own account of this, <i>

Dampier sailed was the &ldquo;Cygnet.&rdquo; That ship separated from
Captain Davis in the &ldquo;Batchelor&rsquo;s Delight&rdquo; in Realejo
Harbor, August 27, 1685. See Lionel Wafer&rsquo;s <i>Voyage and

"#xd0e3761src" id="xd0e3761">8</a></span> &ldquo;Soon after the
beginning of the spiritual conquest of Tagalos, the Society undertook
the administration of Cainta, a village close to Mariquina. Because the
rectitude of its minister, Father Miguel Pareja, restrained some Indian
chiefs, so that they should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e3764"
href="#xd0e3764">138n</a>]</span>not use for themselves the property of
the community, to the injury of the rest, they, seeing the excellent
opportunity afforded to them by the ecclesiastical tribunal, endeavored
to avail themselves of it, instigated by one who should, on account of
his character and his obligations, have restrained them. They are an
insolent people, and a seditious person (who is never lacking) can
easily disturb the minds of the crowd. They hastened to complain to the
archbishop of his ministers, and he, without hearing the Society,
despoiled it of that administration, on March 16, 1688, and bestowed it
on the religious of St. Augustine. The archbishop demanded aid from the
governor in order to arrest Father Diego de Ayala and Father Pedro
Cano, on complaints either frivolous or false, without having made any
specific charges against them, or notifying their superiors.&rdquo;
(Murillo Velarde, fol. 345.)</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;From the first conquest Cainta was a visita

usually is worth two or three reals, reached the price of twelve pesos.
In La Estacada there was a great conflagration on Good Friday, in the
night, which destroyed many houses. In the following year the scarcity
of food was increased by a plague of locusts, which swept away all
[vegetation]; and a caban of rice came to be worth twenty and
twenty-four reals. But what caused the most suffering was the havoc
made by the catarrh, in the year 1687&ndash;88; it was a sort of

Diego Viga, received two letters and an official report, with many
depositions of witnesses, which were sent to him by the alcalde-mayor
of the province of Ilocos.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3937src" href=
"#xd0e3937">1</a> These letters and documents were to the effect that
by the continued residence of Bachelor Sebastian Arqueros de Robles,
ecclesiastical head of the bishopric of Nueva Segovia, in the village
of Vigan (which is the capital of the said province of
Ilocos)&mdash;under the pretext of ministering <i>ad interim</i> to the
natives of the village of Bangues,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3943src"
href="#xd0e3943">2</a> which had for many years remained
vacant&mdash;the natives were becoming uneasy and disturbed. This was
hindering in the exercise of their duties not only the officers of
justice, but also Licentiate Diego de Espinosa Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n,
the proprietary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150">150</a>]</span>beneficed cura of the said village of Vigan,
with whom the said acting bishop had notorious disputes. [According to
the aforesaid documents], all the trouble arose from the fact that the
said ecclesiastical ruler maintained his brothers and relatives in the
said village, who with his authority and presence there were causing
notable injuries and annoyances; and a decree was asked from the royal
Audiencia, providing that the said acting bishop should nominate in the
usual form persons for presentation to the benefice of Bangues, and
that he should change his residence to the capital of his diocese,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e3951src" href="#xd0e3951">3</a> and should not
live at the village of Vigan, except during the period which is allowed
to the ecclesiastical visitors by the holy Council.</p>

<p>This royal decree was accordingly issued, and the said acting bishop
replied that his residence in the village of Vigan was by the order and
command of the archbishop, and that he had no way in which to fulfil
the decree; and he presented the warrant and order which he held for
the said residence, and some informal certificates by a few religious.
This royal Audiencia, considering the disturbances and troubles which
might result from issuing the second royal decree, ordered that it be
temporarily suspended; and that meanwhile the president, governor, and
captain-general should discuss and confer with the archbishop as to
measures for securing peace, and those most expedient for a good
example to the community. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>

<p>This verbal reply<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3959src" href=
"#xd0e3959">4</a> which the said archbishop gave to the said governor
gave occasion for the issue of a royal decree that the said archbishop
should command the ecclesiastical ruler of Nueva Segovia to go to
reside at the capital of his bishopric; but the latter would not obey,
excusing himself with various pretexts. The said archbishop and his
attorney-general [<i>promotor fiscal</i>] repeatedly urged that he be
furnished with certified copies of the acts in virtue of which the
royal decrees had been issued; and in the last petition, presented by
the said attorney-general, he inserted the following clause:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order that his Majesty may apply the needed corrective,
and remove the violence and oppression experienced by the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction; for, if one of its ministers attempts to
administer justice to a subordinate, the culprit finds shelter in the
royal Audiencia&mdash;not only to free himself from ecclesiastical
justice, but also that they may begin legal proceedings against, and
even exile, his superior and judge, who rightly desires and strives to
punish him. And all the above was made evident by the aforesaid acts;
and it has come to our knowledge through trustworthy persons that, in
the petitions which were presented for the issuance of the said
decrees, the respect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152">152</a>]</span>due to the archbishop and to his high office
was forgotten; and that, in the investigations which were made for this
purpose, inquiries were directed into the hidden faults of
ecclesiastical persons, and attempt had been made to punish them with
the first of the said decrees, without punishing the chief authors [of
those evil acts], who were laymen. Moreover, decrees had been issued
only against the ecclesiastical judge on account of their own hidden
faults, or those of other persons, intimidating him therewith in order
that he should not administer justice in future; and a satisfactory
account ought to be given to the said archbishop of the reasons which
had influenced this royal Audiencia to issue the decrees. After [the
publication of] the royal and canonical decrees, the archbishop had a
right to command the clerk of the court to give him the said copy; but
for the sake of the quiet and comfort of this community, he had
commanded him first to request the acts from this royal Audiencia,
making the proper and necessary requisitions therefor, and asking that
the said secretary of the Audiencia be ordered and commanded to give
him the said copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it was evident that the motives which existed for the despatch of
the first royal decree were still further justified by such writings,
the second was issued, which the said archbishop obeyed no better; on
the contrary he said, in the reply that he made to this second royal
decree, that he entreated the royal Audiencia to give little hope for
aid to the ecclesiastics.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3974src" href=
"#xd0e3974">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>

<p>The royal Audiencia, influenced by the report made to it by the
fiscal, and considering the disrespectful and indecorous character of
the attorney-general&rsquo;s communication, and that it was entirely
directed against the reputation and equitable procedure of the supreme
tribunal and its ministers, issued a royal decree that the archbishop
should punish his attorney-general, and should be warned how much he
had derogated from his own dignity by having allowed such lack of
respect. To this the archbishop replied that the attorney-general did
not deserve punishment, because the petition had been presented by his
own order and mandate.</p>

<p>At this time the ecclesiastical cabildo presented themselves in
recourse to the royal Audiencia, with a paper signed by their dean,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e3984src" href="#xd0e3984">6</a> the
dignitaries, the canons, and the other prebends, imploring the royal
aid against the archbishop on account of the acts of fuerza and
violence which were suffered by the cabildo, its members, and all the
clergy.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3987src" href="#xd0e3987">7</a> They
declared that the worst of these were due to the fact that the said
archbishop had at his side a religious of the Order of St. Dominic,
named Fray Raymundo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154">154</a>]</span>Verart;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3992src"
href="#xd0e3992">8</a> that the archbishop had retained him, ever since
he came from Spain, under the title of counselor [<i lang=
"es">asesor</i>] and director; that he had gained such influence that
he directed all the actions of the said archbishop; and that his
decisions were so extraordinary that he kept all minds in a state of
notable disquiet&mdash;to such a degree that he even refused recourse
from the acts of fuerza, endeavoring to render the jurisdiction of the
archbishop absolute, and to exclude his Majesty (as represented in the
Audiencia) from his highest prerogative, that of aid to his oppressed
ecclesiastical vassals. They represented that the archbishop acted as
an advocate in the very suits in which he was judge; that he lived
outside the city, in a hospital of Sangleys<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4001src" href="#xd0e4001">9</a> which is in charge of the
religious of St. Dominic, from which resulted injury and delay in the
despatch of business; that he could think of nothing but his friars,
and behaved as one of them&mdash;for on the day of election of
provincial he had rendered obedience to the father who was elected, and
in the procession he walked in the fifth rank&mdash;regarding himself
as first of all a friar, although he was archbishop-elect; and that he
treated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=
"#pb155">155</a>]</span>the cabildo and its members ill, showing
aversion to them.</p>

<p>With this petition for relief the dean and cabildo presented a mass
of records in proof of their argument, asking that decrees be issued:
one for the archbishop, that he should remove from his side the said
Fray Raymundo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4008src" href=
"#xd0e4008">10</a> and another for the father provincial of St.
Dominic, that he should send the said religious to the remote parts of
the missions in charge of his order, agreeably to the purpose and
vocation for which he had come to these islands at the cost of the
royal exchequer.</p>

<p>In this matter both first and second decrees were issued for the
said archbishop and the father provincial of St. Dominic, neither of
whom was willing to render obedience, the archbishop returning some
very uncivil answers.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4016src" href=
"#xd0e4016">11</a> Finally, the latter took exception to Doctor Don
Diego Calderon, assigning as the cause of this proceeding his remarks
about the ecclesiastical jurisdiction; he also challenged Don Diego
Antonio de Viga [the fiscal] for the mode of expression which he had
used in his writings. By this expedient the proceedings of the
Audiencia were suspended, for lack of judges&mdash;for at that time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>it
contained only the two gentlemen, Don Francisco de Montemayor and Don
Diego Calderon&mdash;until Doctors Don Christoval de Grimaldo and Don
Pedro Sebastian de Bolivar y Mena, the recently-arrived [auditors],<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4021src" href="#xd0e4021">12</a> could examine
the question of the said challenge. At the petition of Doctor Don
Estevan Lorenzo de la Fuente y Alanis, who also had just arrived, they
declared that there was no cause for it; and without doubt it would
result thus, since the challenge was not sworn to, or presented, in
accordance with the regulations of the royal laws. They likewise
commanded that the said archbishop be requested and charged to maintain
in all things friendly relations with the [royal] ministers, not only
in writing to them but in speech. When he was notified of this royal
decree, he gave a very sharp answer, and concluded by saying that his
own behavior would be governed in accordance with the actions of the
ministers, as he thus tells them in all his replies.</p>

<p>This royal Audiencia, considering his insolent replies and
disobedience to the royal decrees, and the scandals thus caused, and
that the whole arose from the influence of Father Raymundo Verart,
determined, for the more thorough justification and proof of the whole
matter; that an investigation should be made by the auditor Don Pedro
de Bolivar, with regard to the injuries and other pernicious
consequences which were being caused to the public welfare, and which
gave occasion to the complaint of the ecclesiastical cabildo about the
assistance rendered to the archbishop by the said father Fray Raymundo
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157">157</a>]</span>Verart&mdash;[all the more] as his illustrious
Lordship had, before the said father came to these islands, conducted
himself in entire harmony and most friendly intercourse with the royal
Audiencia, the ecclesiastical cabildo, and the other courts. The affair
being in this condition, the said father provincial, Fray Baltasar de
Santa Cruz, was summoned before the royal [court in] session, where
they related to him the pernicious consequences to the public welfare
which were accruing from the said assistance [of Father Verart], and
were steadily increasing on account of his acts of disobedience. The
said provincial was admonished to the fulfilment and execution of what
was charged upon him in the said two royal decrees, making him
responsible for all the difficulties that might result; but he resisted
them at every point, repeating his [former] replies. This bold attitude
caused the Audiencia, on even more justifiable grounds, to despatch a
third decree, which the said father provincial, Fray Baltasar de Santa
Cruz, persisted in disobeying.</p>

<p>In the midst of these proceedings, another decree against the said
archbishop was claimed and demanded by Bachelor Diego de Espinosa
Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n, saying that his Lordship had denied the just
appeal that he had made from an act which entailed [on him] an
irreparable hardship; and a royal decree was issued for him that the
said archbishop must grant the said appeal; or, even if he were not
obliged to grant it, his acts must be sent [to the Audiencia], in order
to know whether he committed fuerza in denying the appeal.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4030src" href="#xd0e4030">13</a> The said archbishop
did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158">158</a>]</span>obey this decree; before this, he had not, at
the outset, consented to let a receptor of this royal Audiencia enter
to make known to him one of its acts; and the matter was not followed
up (although in this recourse they went so far as to despatch the
second decree), for Bachelor Diego de Espinosa Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n
desisted from it, at the instance of certain persons.</p>

<p>To the above-mentioned changes and indispensable acts of assistance
granted by this royal Audiencia, is added that which was secured by the
illustrious bishop-elect of Nueva Segovia, Doctor Don Francisco Pizarro
de Orellana, who came before the royal Audiencia, saying that the
archbishop had, in the credentials which he had given to the bishop,
reserved for his own cognizance the case of Bachelor Diego de Espinosa
Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n&mdash;although this was a trial in the first
instance, and the said bachelor was under the bishop&rsquo;s parochial
care and was cura of the benefice of Vigan, one of the parishes
belonging to his bishopric. The said bishop requested a royal decree
that the papers should be furnished to him by the said archbishop in
the customary form, and that the said cases should be referred to him.
In this affair they went so far as to issue the fourth royal decree;
but the said archbishop did not obey one of them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4039src" href="#xd0e4039">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>

<p>The same resistance was encountered by four other royal decrees
issued against the said archbishop, at the demand, and appeal from
fuerza, interposed by Master Don Geronimo de Herrera y Figueroa, cantor
of this holy cathedral church. He was a prisoner of the said archbishop
in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s of this city, an indictment having
been brought against him, charging him with being guilty of disrespect
for the archiepiscopal dignity, and having at the session of the
cabildo concurred in their demand for relief,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4047src" href="#xd0e4047">15</a> of which mention has been
made&mdash;that the said archbishop should remove from his side Fray
Raymundo Verart, and the rest that is stated above. The said Master Don
Geronimo had alleged that the said archbishop was not competent to act
as judge, of which exception he had notified the prelate; but the
latter without settling this question&mdash;which, as pre-judicial,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4050src" href="#xd0e4050">16</a> ought to have
been summarily decided&mdash;proceeded in the case. Even if he were a
competent judge, he ought to proceed with the adjunct judges,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4058src" href="#xd0e4058">17</a> as ordained by the
holy Council of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160">160</a>]</span>Trent; but, [not] heeding these considerations,
the said archbishop proceeded with fuerza and violence, which he
wreaked on Don Geronimo&rsquo;s person. This case was decidedly within
the cognizance of this royal Audiencia, and to its organization and
civil jurisdiction belongs the removal of the fuerza with which the
prelate had oppressed Don Geronimo. Upon this ground they issued the
said four decrees, to attain their object, in order that the said
archbishop should send them the acts, so that it might be ascertained
whether or not he had committed fuerza, or else should send these with
his notary; but he refused to obey the decrees.</p>

<p>The royal Audiencia, striving, in whatever pertained to its side, to
avoid inflicting the chastisement which his actions demanded, in order
to see whether their tolerance would constrain him to lay aside his
arbitrary proceedings, had suspended, with the clause &ldquo;for the
present,&rdquo; the execution of the penalties of banishment which he
was declared to have incurred.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4072src" href=
"#xd0e4072">18</a> This suspension had been attributed to negligence of
the Audiencia&mdash;at which all the people were quite disconsolate;
afterward it was known that the court had not acted without very
deliberate resolution, which had been influenced no little by the
zealous efforts of the governor; when all were hoping for a change in
the sentiments of the archbishop, the courage of the auditors was still
further strengthened. For the Order of the Society [of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>Jesus] presented
an executory decree, issued by the royal and supreme Council of Indias,
in regard to the precedence of the college of San Joseph over that of
Santo Tomas, which is in charge of the Dominican religious&mdash;in
which matter the Society has encountered much opposition from that
order; they have even gone so far as to break out in threats, which the
Society has seen carried out. But immediately the ecclesiastical
attorney-general, with license from the archbishop (who had made legal
complaint), demanded in the royal Audiencia aid and the proper
documents against the decree,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4080src" href=
"#xd0e4080">19</a> in order that the commander of the capitana
&ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo;&mdash;which had just put back through stress
of weather, and had not yet reached the port&mdash;might be furnished
with a warrant for the seizure of the bales [of merchandise] which, he
said, were coming in the said ship on the account of the Society of
Jesus. At the same time the reverend Father Francisco Salgado,
provincial of the said order of the Society, came before the said royal
Audiencia with a plea of appeal, on account of which the said
archbishop instituted suit against that father&rsquo;s order, opposing
the numerous privileges and bulls of exemption which aid it. While
these actions were pending, and before anything had been decided in
them, the said father provincial made representations that,
notwithstanding the said questions were still (as I have said)
unsettled, he was informed that a notary of the said archbishop had
gone to the said ship on various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>matters of business, thus showing lack of
respect to this royal Audiencia. He urged that documents should be
issued, in order that no further proceedings be taken in this matter,
and that the commander of the ship should not permit [the seizure of
goods] until the points at issue were settled. But, although these
decrees were issued, they produced no result; for, as is evident from
competent testimony, the agents of the archbishop went to the said
ship, on the day following that on which the attorney-general had
demanded aid, and, without presenting any warrant to the commander, had
undertaken and proceeded to make seizures and deposits of bales.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4085src" href="#xd0e4085">20</a> This affair
was not finally decided, because it was known outside of court that the
archbishop had relinquished his claims therein.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4091src" href="#xd0e4091">21</a></p>

<p>In this royal Audiencia a suit was pending for a long time between
Captain Don Pedro de Sarmiento y Leoz, as husband of Do&ntilde;a
Michaela de Lisarralde<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4099src" href=
"#xd0e4099">22</a>&mdash;daughter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>of Don Juan de Lisarralde, and
great-granddaughter of Do&ntilde;a Maria de Roa, deceased, who had been
executrix for the said Don Juan de Lisarralde, and guardian of the said
Do&ntilde;a Michaela&mdash;against Father Geronimo de Ortega of the
Society of Jesus (who had been executor<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4104src" href="#xd0e4104">23</a> for Bachelor Nicol&aacute;s
Cordero, and is executor for the said Do&ntilde;a Maria de Roa), over
the guardianship and inheritance which belonged to the said Do&ntilde;a
Michaela, and the account which had been demanded for all the above
affairs. The said father, in conformity with the acts which had been
made known to him in this regard, presented the accounts in the royal
Audiencia, after the appointment, acceptance, and oath-taking of
auditors therefor. This suit, as stated, lasted a long time,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4110src" href="#xd0e4110">24</a> and in it came up
revised acts of the said royal Audiencia ordering that all who were
interested in the said executorships should prefer their claims in the
said royal Audiencia. The affair being in this condition, the said
captain Don Pedro Sarmiento&mdash;urged on by Licentiate Nicol&agrave;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>de la
Vega Caraballo,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4118src" href=
"#xd0e4118">25</a> an ally of the archbishop&mdash;demanded before the
said archbishop that the said Father Ortega should be commanded, under
penalty of censure, to furnish him the said accounts. This command was
laid upon him by repeated acts; nevertheless, the said father refused
[the ecclesiastical] jurisdiction, since he had [the case] in a
competent tribunal, pending judgment, and the said accounts had been
presented&mdash;in proof of which he presented sworn statements to the
said archbishop. Nevertheless, the latter persisted in ordering the
said father to give him the said accounts&mdash;even going so far as to
denounce him as excommunicated. The ground for this action was, that in
the ecclesiastical court demand had been made by the said Don Pedro for
the surrender of the bequest<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4121src" href=
"#xd0e4121">26</a> to the said Archdeacon Cordero. Father Ortega made
appeal in the proper quarter from this censure, but the archbishop
refused to allow the said appeal; from this arose the recourse to royal
aid from the act of fuerza in having denied to the father the said
appeal and attempted to compel him to what he had no right to
do&mdash;the surrender of the said accounts, which had already been
presented in the said royal Audiencia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4127src" href="#xd0e4127">27</a> On that account, and because of
the very nature of the case, it was wholly within the cognizance of the
royal Audiencia, and concerned laymen. For this <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>reason, the usual royal
decree was issued, in order that the notary should come to make report.
This being made known to the archbishop, he made a very prolix reply,
taking the ground, in very disrespectful language, that the appeal was
not legitimate, and that he was not obliged to send the documents; but
saying that, upon the necessary declarations, and with the stipulation
that the acts should not pass into the possession of any official of
the Audiencia, but must remain in the hands of his own notary, he would
give orders that the latter should go to make the report, whenever the
Audiencia should command it, but he must refuse to absolve the said
father. The Audiencia, in order to avoid new occasions for controversy
with this prelate, overlooked his imposing upon it a condition, and one
which was so unusual. Domingo Diaz<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4135src"
href="#xd0e4135">28</a> having made the report, and noted in the course
of it two false assertions&mdash;which he discovered while inspecting
the acts, having read them through&mdash;the said notary went away,
carrying them with him, without waiting for the opinion and decision of
the said royal Audiencia on them to be affirmed. That tribunal declared
the said suit,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4138src" href=
"#xd0e4138">29</a> and the cognizance of it, as it concerned laymen, to
be altogether secular&mdash;as were also questions of guardianship,
inheritance, the charge of property, dowries, and other matters of that
nature; and that, by virtue of this, all [episcopal] acts regarding
these questions be suspended in this royal Audiencia. As for the <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>pious
legacies contained in the said testaments, the archbishop was declared
to have committed fuerza in not granting to Father Ortega the appeal
which he had interposed before the delegate of his Holiness; and the
Audiencia resolved that, in consequence of all the above facts, the
prelate should absolve the said father, and immediately remove his name
from the list of excommunicated persons, and that a royal decree [to
this effect] be issued in his behalf. When this was made known to the
archbishop, he gave an extremely insolent and uncivil reply, opposing
the authority of this royal Audiencia, the royal jurisdiction, the
governor, and the auditors. He refused to send the acts [to the
Audiencia], or to absolve the said father, and declared in plain terms
that he would persist in this opposition, and that the Audiencia might
therefore inflict whatever violence they chose on him and his
dignity.</p>

<p>Another instance: Sargento-mayor Don Juan Gallardo&mdash;who was
chief magistrate, castellan, and commander of the seamen and sailors,
in the port of Cavite (the most important port in these islands, and
its command one of the highest military posts)&mdash;had a prisoner, an
artillerist named Loren&ccedil;o Magno.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4157src" href="#xd0e4157">30</a> The said archbishop sent him a
letter of requisition, demanding that Don Juan hand over to him the
said prisoner and the suit that had been brought against him; or that
he should declare under oath whether or not that suit was in his hands.
In this letter of requisition the archbishop did not state the cause
for which his illustrious Lordship said he <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>had accused the aforesaid
[prisoner, which was] bigamy. The said castellan, moreover, noticed in
it certain imperative expressions and the archbishop addressed him as
<i>vos</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;you&rdquo;],<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4168src" href="#xd0e4168">31</a> in the manner which is customary
in the royal decrees. The said castellan sent the prisoner to the
archbishop, who issued another letter of requisition, in the same form
as the preceding, at the petition of Francisca Ignacia, wife of the
said Loren&ccedil;o Magno&mdash;against whom, it was declared, he was
carrying on a suit for divorce&mdash;demanding that immediately,
without any delay, under penalty of excommunication and a fine of five
hundred pesos, the said castellan should within three hours deliver to
the notary a certified statement of the suit which he had instituted
against the said Loren&ccedil;o Magno. The castellan came before the
royal Audiencia with his deposition regarding these two letters of
requisition, demanding that the said archbishop be requested and
charged to observe, in the communications that he might send to the
judicial officers of his Majesty, the forms ordained by law, treating
the magistrates with the courtesy due to their position. These acts
having been considered in the Audiencia, a royal decree was despatched
requiring that the said archbishop must, in the requisitions which he
might send to the royal magistrates, treat them with due politeness,
conforming to the forms of law and usage&mdash;not using imperative
terms, or the word <i lang="es">vos</i>. When the archbishop <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>was
notified of this royal decree, he gave an answer full of uncivil,
improper, and disrespectful expressions against the royal jurisdiction,
the governor, and the auditors. The latter had issued an act that
Doctor Don Joseph Zervantes and Master Nicolas de la Vega Caravallo
should not meddle with the profession of advocate, into which they had
thrust themselves&mdash;from which resulted consequences pernicious to
the public welfare, since they had not taken the courses of study in
the school of law. When notified of the act, they replied that the
archbishop had already ordered them not to plead in secular tribunals,
and the said Caravallo added that he was the only one who could issue
such commands. On the following day the archbishop issued an act in
opposition to that of the Audiencia, commanding that no petitions
should be accepted in his court that were not signed by the said Doctor
Zervantes and Master Caravallo. The fiscal, when all the replies had
been shown to him, demanded that, without giving opportunity for any
further acts of disobedience or disrespect, they should execute upon
the person of the reverend archbishop the penalties which he had been
declared to have incurred&mdash;banishment, and the loss of his secular
revenue [<i lang="es">temporalidades</i>]; and that, for this purpose,
the clause &ldquo;for the present,&rdquo; contained in the act of
October 1 in the past year of 82, be revoked and erased, and the act
put into execution on May 1 of the said year [<i>i.e.</i>, 1683]. These
acts having been considered by the royal Audiencia with the attention
and mature deliberation which so grave a matter demanded, it was
decided that sentence of banishment should be executed on the
archbishop, and that he should be sent to the <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb169" href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>village of Lingayen, in the
province of Pangasinan, a village of Christian Indians in charge of the
Dominican religious. This charge was committed to Doctor Don
Christ&ograve;val Grimaldo de Herrera and Sargento-mayor Juan de
Veristain, alcalde-in-ordinary, who fulfilled it with the utmost
discretion, quietness, and moderation;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4187src" href="#xd0e4187">32</a> and the archbishop was embarked
in a barcoluengo, in which the forethought of the governor had provided
all his kitchen equipment, with everything else that was necessary for
his support and the needs of the voyage.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4190src" href="#xd0e4190">33</a></p>

<p>The royal Audiencia had proceeded very cautiously, for, foreseeing
the tumults or disturbances that are wont to arise on such occasions,
and endeavoring to avoid whatever could serve as an incentive thereto,
they recognized that the ringing of the bells in making any
demonstrations might act as such incentive; and they asked the governor
to command that guards be posted in the bell-tower of the church, and
in the house of Master Juan Gon&ccedil;alez de Guzman, the provisor, so
that the latter could not order any demonstration to be made while the
sentence of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170">170</a>]</span>banishment was being executed. On the same day
when this was done, the royal Audiencia sent a decree to the cabildo,
ordering that they should conduct themselves in all respects amicably
with the royal Audiencia and the other royal officials, not allowing
any acts of violence to be inflicted on the vassals of his Majesty, or
hindering them from appealing to the Audiencia in cases of fuerza. The
cabildo were also warned not to accept any documents of appointment
from the ruler of the archbishopric, or allow him to exercise
jurisdiction, until the person appointed should present himself before
the royal court, where he must take the customary oath. To this decree
the cabildo rendered obedience; and, the very illustrious master Don
Fray Ximenez Barrientos, bishop of Troya and assistant bishop of these
islands, having presented himself before the cabildo with the
appointment of ruler [of the archdiocese]&mdash;which the archbishop
had conferred upon him on the twenty-seventh of March, when the said
archbishop was already declared an exile&mdash;he was referred by the
cabildo to the Audiencia. Being present there, his appointment was, in
consequence of the demand made by the fiscal that license should not be
granted to him, suspended in that court, for weighty reasons there
presented, and it was referred to the Council, in order that his
Majesty might decide according to his pleasure; and [it was declared
that] in the interim the cabildo should govern the archdiocese.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4197src" href="#xd0e4197">34</a> And here it
occurs to me to remark, parenthetically, that, although the secrets and
the justifiable motives of the Audiencia are inscrutable, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>we may regard it
as probable that their principal reason for this action was their
knowledge of the fact that this bishop, a few days after arriving in
this city, had preached in the convent of Santo Domingo, on the day of
the naval battle,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4208src" href=
"#xd0e4208">35</a> and the entire tendency of his sermon was to
disparage the royal jurisdiction and rebuke those who would appeal to
it. He said that this entire city was a university of vices, although
of that he could have had no experience; and it was he who had exerted
most influence on the actions of the archbishop, over and over again
strengthening him in acts of disobedience [to the secular government].
The cabildo, since the Audiencia had not accepted the said bishop as
ecclesiastical ruler, declared that the see was vacant by
interpretation [of that act]; and the bishop of Troya replied that they
could not have sent him better news, as he did not desire to take
charge of other men&rsquo;s flocks. Thereupon he immediately went back
to the convent of San Juan del Monte, outside the walls of this city;<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4223src" href="#xd0e4223">36</a> and on the
following day a Dominican <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172">172</a>]</span>religious set out to stir up the other
religious orders (except the Society), that after sunset prayers they
should ring the bells for an interdict. This was done by [the convent
of] Santo Domingo.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4233src" href=
"#xd0e4233">37</a> [He also told them] that Master Juan Gonzalez de
Guzm&agrave;n, provisor of the said archbishop, would post as
excommunicated the dean, Master Don Miguel Ortiz de Cobarrubias, whom
the cabildo had appointed ecclesiastical ruler. At this, the dean asked
the governor for the aid of some infantry, to go to the convent of
Santo Domingo, to which the said master had retreated, to remove him
thence. This was granted; but, on going to the said convent, they
encountered much opposition to their entrance, on the part of the
religious. The dean was so insolently treated by them that he was
obliged, in order to prevent greater troubles, to return and inform the
governor and the royal Audiencia, then in session. That court issued a
royal decree to notify the superiors of the religious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>orders that in
publishing an interdict<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4255src" href=
"#xd0e4255">38</a> they must follow the metropolitan church [<i lang=
"es">matriz</i>]; and thus was prevented a great scandal, disturbance,
and popular commotion in this city&mdash;in which, since the said
sentence of banishment was carried out, the utmost peace has been
experienced, nor has there occurred the slightest disturbance. <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174">174</a>]</span></p>

<p>I must not omit, since it is a part of this account, the following
information: On Epiphany [<i lang="es">dia de Reyes</i>; in 1682] while
the royal Audiencia were present in the holy cathedral church, a sermon
was preached there by father Fray Francisco de Villalva, a Dominican
religious, whose language was insolent in the highest degree. He spoke
openly and expressly against the governor, the auditors, and the
ecclesiastical cabildo (which he pointed out as the source of
disturbances in the community), saying to the archbishop: &ldquo;Let
not your illustrious Lordship concern himself with the secular
revenues; look to God [for maintenance].&rdquo; He tried to disparage
the royal jurisdiction, and rebuked appeals to the
Audiencia&mdash;saying so much that he gave cause for that tribunal to
send by its chaplain a message to the archbishop, asking him to order
the preacher to cease. His illustrious Lordship replied that the
preacher was doing his duty, and the latter, in the face of these
demonstrations, went on with the sermon even to the end. Afterward, by
order of the court, the auditor Don Pedro de Bolivar put the said
father on a ship, to be taken to the province of Cadbalogan&mdash;in
which he must remain until the opportunity should arrive, by the
departure of a ship [from Manila], for him to embark for Madrid,
whither the acts were to be sent. This was carried out, and, although
the ship was driven back to port, he is now going on board the
capitana.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4270src" href="#xd0e4270">39</a>
May God <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175">175</a>]</span>conduct these affairs for our good, and
preserve your Grace<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4280src" href=

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">A curious relation of events in the city of Manila
since the arrival of the ships in the year 1684.</h3>

<p>On the ninth of July the bells were rung for the [arrival of the]
ship &ldquo;Santa Rosa,&rdquo; with certain news that it was opposite
Baco, and had brought the new governor, Admiral Don Gabriel de
Curucelaegui y Arriola&mdash;who, on account of the fury of the storms,
would not be able to make his entrance into this city until August 24.
[On that occasion] he was received with loud applause, triumphal
arches, and laudatory speeches. On that day occurred some memorable
events. At five o&rsquo;clock in the morning there was a severe
earthquake, although it caused but little damage to the city. In the
afternoon, while his Lordship, before entering through the Puerta Real,
was taking the customary oath in order that the keys might be delivered
to him, the horse of his Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal became unruly, and
attacked those who were near him with kicks and bites. He who came out
worst from this was the secretary whom his Lordship brought over; he
was injured in one leg by some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"
href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>kicks, from the effects of which he
suffered for several days.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4300src" href=
"#xd0e4300">41</a> When the governor had entered the city, and when he
was about two pike-lengths from the gate, the balcony above it, which
was full of people, fell; some were killed, others crippled or maimed,
and others bruised. Among them were friars and lay-brothers, negroes
and whites. With these events, the common people began to indulge in
much gossip.</p>

<p>When Don Gabriel had taken possession of his government, his first
act was to retire Captain Mateo Lopez Perea, and to make Captain Miguel
Sanchez government secretary, quite contrary to their wishes. The
second was to appoint as chief chaplain of the royal chapel the canon
Master Don Pablo de Aduna, as a reward for having always withdrawn
himself from the cabildo, without choosing to acknowledge it as
ecclesiastical ruler. The third (and the source of many others) was to
bring back our troubles, so that the whole pancake [<i>tortilla</i>]
was turned bottom upwards&mdash;even going so far as to revoke the
sentence of banishment on the archbishop, and bring him to Manila.
This, as those say who understand the matter, is the most extraordinary
thing that has occurred anywhere in the Spanish domain; for he was
exiled for disobeying sixteen royal decrees and I have given an account
to his Majesty of these sixteen points of disobedience, or [rather]
this disobedience of sixteen points. The preambles of these points, or
their history, required much time and no little paper; but they will be
summarized as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>After the exile of the archbishop, the actions, conversations, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>and sermons
of the Dominican fathers were so wild and extravagant, against the
members of the Audiencia, the ecclesiastical cabildo, and the Theatins
[<i>i.e.</i>, the Jesuits], that their mildest act was to call all of
the latter Pharisees or heretics, and utter other jests of that sort,
even from the pulpit. Consequently the royal Audiencia felt obliged to
advise its president, then Don Juan de Vargas, that he should apply a
corrective to these acts. This was a royal decree, requesting and
charging the [Dominican] provincial to send to the port of Cavite the
friars Bartolome Marron,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4318src" href=
"#xd0e4318">42</a> Raimundo Verart, and P. Pedroche,<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e4324src" href="#xd0e4324">43</a> and to make them ready, at the
cost of the order, for [the journey to] Espa&ntilde;a; and to send to
Cagayan the two lecturers in theology, Fray Juan de Santo Domingo<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4330src" href="#xd0e4330">44</a> and Fray
Francisco de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178">178</a>]</span>Vargas,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4340src"
href="#xd0e4340">45</a> and not allow them to leave that province
without a special order from the government. The provincial answered
that those religious had not done any of the things that were alleged
of them except by his order, and that therefore the blame, if there
were any, was his and not theirs; and that all of them were ready to
die for the faith. Again he was requested and charged as before, the
provincial<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4346src" href="#xd0e4346">46</a>
also being summoned to go to Espa&ntilde;a, to give account of his
acts. These orders were resisted, whereupon the convent was surrounded
with infantry. As the provincial and Fray Pedroche refused to go out
afoot, the soldiers took them from the convent, carrying them with the
utmost propriety and respect, by order of the provisor, who was
summoned for this function. They went away, <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>Father Pedroche hurling
excommunications, from which escaped only the alcalde-in-ordinary
Pimentel, who conveyed them to Cavite, because he had given them
excellent bread and pastries. At this, not only the Dominican fathers
and their friends took to flight, but Quintero<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4354src" href="#xd0e4354">47</a> and his barangay&mdash;especially
when they saw some embarked for Espa&ntilde;a, and others for Cagayan.
Then, the news of the change in government having come, was begun the
fabrication of a scheme or plot, well covered up, as follows:</p>

<p>They fully persuaded the governor that this<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4368src" href="#xd0e4368">48</a> one was a schismatic&mdash;as it
were, another Inglaterra in the time of Henry VIII; and, to forward
their schemes&mdash;as he had, before all the religious orders,
recognized the cabildo as ecclesiastical ruler&mdash;they persuaded the
father provincial of St. Augustine, Father Jos&eacute; Duque, to
render, and command all his friars to render, obedience to the bishop
of Troya<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4374src" href=
"#xd0e4374">49</a>&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180">180</a>]</span>who had been nominated as head of the diocese
by the archbishop, but whose appointment the royal Audiencia had
suspended. The father provincial did so, in a circular letter sent to
all the friars of his order, arousing the resentment that might be
expected in the ecclesiastical cabildo, and much more in the royal
Audiencia.</p>

<p>As soon as the news of the ship arrived, the Troyan wrote and made
public a document with this title: &ldquo;Advice to those who come as
strangers to these islands, that they may not err in their judgment of
things pertaining to the banishment of the archbishop.&rdquo; This
paper had no solidity, and answer to it was made in another, in which
the former was utterly demolished<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4381src"
href="#xd0e4381">50</a> with sharp arguments. The provincial made
another reply, over his signature, of the same quality as the former
document, but with not slight attacks on the authority and patronage of
our king. On the same day when the governor entered the city
[<i>i.e.</i>, August 24] in the afternoon, on that morning came into
Manila Fray Bartolome Marron (who went about secretly), and Fathers
Juan de Santo Domingo and Juan de Vargas, who were the lecturers exiled
to Cagayan; the latter went publicly through the city, scorning the
royal authority by which they were exiled. Immediately began the
intrigue&mdash;which, according to report, came already planned from
Mejico.</p>

<p>The governor questioned the religious orders, requesting and
charging them to answer the points that go with this letter, which were
set forth by the bishop of Troya. The fathers of St. Francis in their
paper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181">181</a>]</span>declared themselves for the king our sovereign,
and approved what had been done by the royal court. The Augustinian
fathers said, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Viva Troya!</i>&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4397src" href="#xd0e4397">51</a> with a document full
of depositions&mdash;some made by so evil a brain as that of Fray
Raimundo Verart (but signed by the father provincial Duque); some by
two stray (that is, recently arrived) lecturers, one of whom confessed
that he had never heard of the works of Solorzano; and the last who
signed the paper was Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, the
procurator-general, who on account of being learned in grammar, thought
that, as versed in the art of Nebrija<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4402src" href="#xd0e4402">52</a> (who was an auditor), it was the
same to know how to conjugate past tenses as to comprehend futures.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4408src" href="#xd0e4408">53</a> The Recollect
fathers followed their brethren, but with so few depositions that I
judge the number did not reach the plural of the Greeks.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4411src" href="#xd0e4411">54</a> This paper was much
commended, and it is something which I admired, knowing that it was the
work of their provincial, Fray Ysidro; and when it was seen it was
recognized as his by the style and manner of expression&mdash;the stamp
of the pulpit, which is that [vocation] for which God has given him
grace. The Theatins evaded a reply, recognizing <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>the game (or rather flame)
[<i lang="es">juego, o fuego</i>] that was being started; but they say
that in their apology they explained this omission, and expressed their
opinions with no little care&mdash;saying that they were ignorant of
what had passed in the sessions of the royal court; and that, as it was
to be inferred that the royal Audiencia had informed his Majesty of
everything, they could not pass judgment on those acts.</p>

<p>These papers, or collections of papers, were going about, when the
Troyan plunged <i>in medias res</i> and decided the question. One
Sunday morning at five o&rsquo;clock, he went with his notary
Caraballo, and fiscals, and an escort of soldiers, and entered all the
churches (except the cathedral), where he published himself as
ecclesiastical ruler, and commanded that they should not recognize the
cabildo as such. To this [he added] the penalty of major
excommunication and of being considered schismatics, if they did not go
to render obedience within three days; and he left posted in all the
churches copies of his act.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4426src" href=
"#xd0e4426">55</a> This was an action so extraordinary that, if this
were a town of the common people, a riot would have occurred. All the
members of the ecclesiastical cabildo repaired to the governor, who
received them with scant welcome, and without giving them the title of
&ldquo;Lordship,&rdquo; [<i lang="es">Se&ntilde;or&iacute;a</i>] which
is their due when they appear officially as the cabildo. He told the
dean to tell his story; and when the latter replied that that cabildo
was not going to tell stories, the governor again told him to go on
with his story. They told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183">183</a>]</span>him in few words what had occurred, and what
had just been done; but when they again told him that the bishop of
Troya had taken with him an escort of soldiers, he said that he had no
knowledge of such a thing. In conclusion, they stated that by three
royal decrees they had been charged with the government [of the see];
and that he should give them another decree, commanding them to
surrender it to the bishop of Troya, or that he should approve the
bishop&rsquo;s appointment, and immediately they would surrender the
government to him; and with that they went away. Immediately the
governor held a session (or rather sessions) of the Audiencia, which
lasted three days; and at the end of that time &ldquo;the mountain
brought forth,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4434src" href=
"#xd0e4434">56</a> by a majority of votes. It resulted that, at ten
o&rsquo;clock at night, there was a peal of bells, as if for a ship
from Castilla; and the members of the cabildo, escorted by many
personages, went to render obedience to the Troyan. He informed them
that he could not absolve them unless they would swear obedience to the
archbishop, which they must also render to his provisor, Juan Gonzalez,
on their knees, asking his pardon for the injuries that they had done
him, and making amends for the losses that he had suffered. When they
resisted, laymen came in among them and undertook to surround them (as
they did); and after they fell on their knees they placed their hands
on the missal, and, as good men who stood in fear of God, they were
granted absolution, but <i lang="la">ad reincidentiam</i>, until the
archbishop should decree what would be most expedient. On another day
the Troyan was received <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184">184</a>]</span>in the cathedral, with military display, the
long ringing of the bells, etc.</p>

<p>The governor, who had already decided to restore the archbishop to
his see<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4450src" href=
"#xd0e4450">57</a>&mdash;but without showing the least indication of
rehabilitating the royal jurisdiction, and establishing obedience to
what had been commanded&mdash;despatched General Don Tomas de Andaya
and Sargento-mayor Don Gonzales Samaniego<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4453src" href="#xd0e4453">58</a> for his illustrious Lordship;
they were accompanied by the Dominican father Fray Baltasar de Santa
Cruz.</p>

<p>His illustrious Lordship came here, and was received with military
display, a salvo of artillery, etc. He entered the city clad in his
pontifical robes, and went to the palace of the governor, who was
awaiting him;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4461src" href=
"#xd0e4461">59</a> they remained a short time in conversation, the
governor straitly charging him [to maintain] peace. Then he went to his
own house, where he found the superiors of the religious orders, who
also had gathered in the cathedral with many other religious to welcome
him. He remained two days <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185">185</a>]</span>within Manila, and, without visiting the
superiors, or returning their visit to him, he contented himself with
calling on Generals Tejada, Andaya, and Quintero; and he crossed, near
San Gabriel, to the house of Don Francisco de Atienza, who is
sargento-mayor of the army.</p>

<p>Everyone promised himself an Octavian peace; but in ten or twelve
days war made its appearance, and the more experienced were continually
in dread. On the twenty-eighth of November, the eve of the feast of the
table of the blessed sacrament, notification was sent to the cabildo,
the superiors of the religious orders, and all the curas and
missionaries within and without the walls, that no one should admit
into any of their churches the auditors, Don Juan de Vargas Hurtado,
and many other persons, both citizens and military officers,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4471src" href="#xd0e4471">60</a> as having incurred
the penalties in the bull <i lang="es">De la cena</i>. At this the
entire community felt as the pious reader can understand, recognizing
that the royal authority had been trampled under foot and
outraged&mdash;and the more so, that some persons who promptly came to
him for absolution were required to swear upon the holy gospels that
they would never aid in the banishment, exile, or imprisonment of an
ecclesiastic, even though this be ordered by the king himself, in
person. Thereupon, they frankly declared that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>would not take
such an oath, and returned to their homes, scandalized at such a reply.
Those who most resented this stroke were the auditors, especially as,
on the following day, when their platform was already placed in the
cathedral, and all had resolved to go there, the archbishop sent them a
message that they should suspend their attendance there for a time,
until these affairs were adjusted. Thereupon, <i lang="la">coram omni
populo</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;in the presence of all the
people&rdquo;] who had gathered to see what was going on, the platform
was removed [from the cathedral]. The auditors keenly resented this;
but since they are to blame in having done what they could not be
forced to do, let them pay the penalty.</p>

<p>The governor astonished at a thing so unexpected, again questioned
the religious orders, in the strictest manner, on various points; the
principal of these was in regard to the royal ministers [<i lang=
"es">comision</i>], whether or not they had incurred censure by having
acted according to the laws of his Majesty&mdash;which was the same as
inquiring whether the said laws were just or unjust. The Augustinians
and Recollects evaded answering this. The Franciscans were doubtful;
but, learning that the Jesuits had answered and publicly declared that
now was the time to stand by our king and give blood and life for him,
and that they all would do so in what was not contrary to the law of
God, the fathers of St. Francis were also encouraged, and they came to
the same resolution. The Theatins gave notice of their decision to the
governor; but they told him that sometimes it was necessary to make the
occasion and whet the blade; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187">187</a>]</span>and, since now they were drawing the sword,
they would strike a sure blow and draw blood. Considering the feelings
of the Audiencia, and its embarrassed condition, they sent one of their
fathers even to its hall of assembly, to make known their resolution to
the auditors; those gentlemen were much relieved, and thanked the
Jesuits for their courtesy. This was made known throughout the city,
and the people expected that this document would be circulated; but it
seems that the threat alone was as effectual as the stroke could have
been. For, at the instance of the governor, his illustrious Lordship
went to the royal court on the sixth day of December, on which was
celebrated the fiesta of St. Francis Javier; and, as the result of his
visit, the session was closed and all [the auditors] went to the
fiesta, to the great joy of the entire city. We do not know what
occurred in the session of the Audiencia;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4497src" href="#xd0e4497">61</a> only one [writer] mentions that
its members were absolved, and others state, more explicitly, that the
absolution was only given in the archbishop&rsquo;s mind, and explained
by himself with a sort of benediction. It seems that, as a result, they
put an end to the lawsuits; but, when the water stopped falling, it
rained pebbles.</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 10, the ecclesiastical cabildo, which had
governed the see, was notified of all these matters, and that it must
be regarded as suspended and under censure<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4505src" href="#xd0e4505">62</a> for having accepted the
government. At the same time, edicts were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>posted making null all the
confessions made to the members of the cabildo or to those persons to
whom they had given license [to hear confessions], and all other things
that had been effected by their authority&mdash;as marriages, [the
bestowal of] chaplaincies and curacies, etc.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4518src" href="#xd0e4518">63</a> These edicts commanded that,
under penalty of major excommunication, <i lang="la">lat&aelig;
sententi&aelig;</i>, all [persons concerned] should present themselves
within six days, with the documents and other papers [in the case];<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4524src" href="#xd0e4524">64</a> thereupon many
men who were dissatisfied with their wives, and women tired of their
husbands, tried to find other spouses who were more congenial. The
scruples of people regarding their confessions may well be imagined;
and this, too, when Lent was past. But the most astute (although harsh)
measure was the command, under the same penalty, that no one should
speak, assert, or teach anything contrary to the tenor of the said
edict. The Dominican fathers, moreover, even said in the pulpits, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>when <i
lang="la">exultant tanquam victores capta preda</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e4532src" href="#xd0e4532">65</a> that there is no person in
these islands, except the Dominican religious, who has the ability or
learning to make a decision in a case of morals. Thus the poor prebends
are suspended; nor have they any recourse, since the royal Audiencia is
now disarmed. The archbishop proceeded to welcome them with much
kindness, telling them that now they came to his illustrious Lordship,
because they had recourse in no other direction&mdash;words which have
aroused much comment, as being insulting to the king and inimical to
his royal patronage; and he added, that they deserved to be degraded
from office and handed over to the secular power. Above all, he tried
to deprive them of their prebends, and to thrust into the cathedral
that dealer in fireworks, Caraballo, and others of that stamp. The
worst is, that he declares that they cannot be dispensed from their
irregular administration [of the see]&mdash;nor can appeal be taken to
the delegate of his Holiness, or to any other&mdash;by any bishop of
these islands, since all four are Dominicans and follow the lead of the
archbishop; and all the four cities and bishoprics of these islands are
entirely unsettled with lawsuits and excommunications at every step. No
attention is paid to the officials of his Majesty, the more discreet of
whom acquiesce. It is necessary to apply a very exemplary corrective;
for they [<i>i.e.</i>, the ecclesiastical authorities] have gone to
such an extreme that to issue royal decrees to them is the same as to
throw caps at the tarasca.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4540src" href=
"#xd0e4540">66</a> They act with contempt for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>royal authority,
which even the most remote barbarians fear and reverence.</p>

<p>On the first of December was published the residencia of Don Juan de
Vargas Hurtado; and a fortnight later the city challenged the judge of
residencia, by saying that it was conducted with fraud, as the said
judge was bribed. The challenge was admitted, and he named for his
associate Se&ntilde;or Calderon; as the latter declined, he named
Se&ntilde;or de Viga, and then Se&ntilde;or Bolivar, both of whom did
the same. The judge continued to nominate other persons, and all
excused themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4552src" href=
"#xd0e4552">67</a> As a result, it seems, Don Juan de Vargas was
anchored to his island<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4558src" href=
"#xd0e4558">68</a> for several years. He himself has caused this, since
he has not the dexterity to apply a curb of silver with the royal arms
to Captain Quintanilla, the scrivener of the residencia&mdash;who still
endeavors to urge it on, although he does not lead the plot.</p>

<p>A second embassy came from Borney; and General Don Juan de Morales
is going with the title of ambassador, to establish peace at once.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e4566src" href="#xd0e4566">69</a> They say a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191">191</a>]</span>Theatin will accompany him, to pave the way for
introducing the faith into that kingdom.</p>

<p>The commander [of the galleon] for Castilla is Don Francisco
Zorrilla; the sargento-mayor, Don Bernardo de Andaya; the chief pilot,
Lazcano. [Here is the list of] alcaldes-mayor: Of Tondo, Don Pedro
Lozano; of Pampanga, Samaniego; of Bulacan, Armijo; of Bay, Don Antonio
de Ortega; of Balayan, Don Juan Antonio de Tabara; of Tayabas, Captain
Conde; of Albay, Captain Ariola; of Pangasinan, Arcega; of Ylocos, the
former sargento-mayor of Cavite; of Calamianes, Don Alonso de Leon; of
Mindoro, Prada; of Panay, Don Agustin Crespo; of the island of Negros,
Captain Adriano; of Caraga, Captain Blas Rodriguez. For accountant of
his Majesty, Juan del Pozo y Gatica; for castellan of Cavite, Don
Alonso de Aponte; for sargento-mayor of that port, Francisco
Sanchez.</p>

<p>Considerable is being done on the galleon in Sorsogon, where the
&ldquo;Santelmo&rdquo; was wrecked; they say that General Don Tomas de
Andaya will go there for its construction, with title of
lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief for Mariveles; he is in high
favor with the governor.</p>

<p>The bishop of Sinopolis is coming from Cebu, his patience quite
exhausted with the follies and impertinences of Don Diego de Aguilar,
who has worn out that unfortunate community with his extravagant
actions, all originating in his insatiable greed. The ecclesiastical
ruler of Cagayan is the bishop of Troya.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third of December the members of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>the cabildo came
again to cast themselves at the feet of the archbishop; and, after a
long harangue of <i>misereres</i> and entreaties, he replied to them by
asking if they were not ashamed to show their faces, and other things
of the like sort, in the tone of a tercerilla,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4589src" href="#xd0e4589">70</a> and then left them. It may well
be imagined with what joy they must have celebrated the Christmas
feasts.</p>

<p>The evil genius of the archbishop at present is Fray Juan
Yba&ntilde;ez, otherwise named de San Domingo; he is the lecturer that
was exiled to Cagayan. He has made strenuous efforts to deprive the
members of the chapter of their prebends&mdash;regarding which the
archbishop had three times sent advice to the governor; the latter
replied, to the third of these communications, that the archbishop
should say no more on this point, because he would not do what he
asked. It is a great pity that this gentleman should have meddled by
recalling the archbishop from banishment, since that act has been the
source of the disturbances in this unhappy community, troubles which
will exist for many years; for it cannot be doubted that he has in
other respects conducted the government well, and with unwearying
efforts&mdash;especially in what concerns the increase of the royal
revenues. But he is thoroughly repentant for his error, at seeing his
hopes of peace frustrated, which was the purpose in his decision.</p>

<h3 class="normal">1685</h3>

<p>The prebendaries remained suspended until the fourth Sunday in Lent
[<i>i.e.</i>, March 25], when the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>[censure for] irregular government was
removed from them; but for this purpose a conference was first summoned
by the archbishop. It included the bishop of Sinopolis, the superiors
and masters of the religious orders&mdash;and with them crowded in all
the swarm of doctors and masters of Santo Tomas, to the no little
annoyance of the bishop and the religious orders. In this conference
the question was asked whether the members of the cabildo were worthy
of being absolved for their irregular acts. All answered in the
affirmative, except little Master Caraballo; and he said that his
illustrious Lordship could not grant the dispensation, as these were
cases that concerned the faith, specifying his declaration in the
document which was drawn up. The Dominican fathers gave the same
opinion; but the bishop of Sinopolis replied to them, saying that if
this were a matter contrary to the faith, as they seemed to imagine,
they could not discuss it, since that pertained to another tribunal; it
was finally decided that the absolution should be given to the
prebendaries. When we were all expecting that this would be done, as it
ought to be, within the body of the ecclesiastical cabildo, the fourth
Sunday of Lent having arrived, the archbishop commanded that there
should be no preaching in any of the churches of this city, or in those
without the walls; and that all the people should repair to the
cathedral in the afternoon. He commanded that two seats should be made
ready there&mdash;one outside the church, in order that the countless
multitude who were present might enjoy this so edifying act; and the
other at the great altar itself. The altar and the cibary were covered
with a canopy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194">194</a>]</span></p>

<p>At ten in the morning, he declared the members of the cabildo to be
excommunicated; and, the facts being as I have already stated above,
they were now absolved <i lang="la">ad reincidentiam</i>, by the bishop
of Troya; such relapse [<i lang="es">reincidencia</i>] had not occurred
in any instance, and therefore the declaration of the canons was
without cause, and only directed at a very scandalous paper on the
absolution&mdash;which was performed with great ostentation, in the
following manner.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon, the archbishop being seated on the chair
which stood outside the holy church, assisted by his provisor, Juan
Gonzalez, and a racionero, the prebends went to him, and, while they
knelt there, a judicial record was read to them of all the offenses
committed&mdash;that is, all the enactments made&mdash;by them while
governing the archbishopric; and, while they were there before the
public in that embarrassing condition, [<i lang="es">en calzas y en
jubon</i>]<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4618src" href="#xd0e4618">71</a>
the names of all those who supported the cabildo, and recognized that
body as the ecclesiastical ruler, were read. He even published the
Theatins, on account of an opinion that they gave to the cabildo at the
latter&rsquo;s request, on the question whether the cabildo could
release on bail the cantor Herrera from prison&mdash;since he did not
appear, nor could his case be prosecuted, nor was there hope that he
would appear soon, for it was more than a year and a half that he had
spent in prison; the Theatins decided this query in the affirmative,
saying that the cabildo not only could, but ought to, release him.
Those who signed the paper were the past provincials, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>Javier Riquelme,
former rector of San Jos&eacute;, and Tomas de Andrade,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e4626src" href="#xd0e4626">72</a> rector of the great
college and of their university; Fathers Alejo Lopez<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e4632src" href="#xd0e4632">73</a> and Jaime Vestart, at present
masters in theology; Ysidro Clarete<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4635src"
href="#xd0e4635">74</a> and Pedro Lope.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4641src" href="#xd0e4641">75</a> Although the matter was so plain,
and the paper was signed by so many fathers, the archbishop annulled
that act, as if he were the supreme pontiff of the Church. This is a
matter at which the Theatins have smiled much, but with a smile that
but conceals their annoyance.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4647src" href=
"#xd0e4647">76</a> The members of the chapter expressed their
detestation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198">198</a>]</span>of all that they had done, and took oath upon
the holy gospels that they would not again commit such crimes, besides
many other oaths that they took, which were required from
them&mdash;oaths very offensive to the king our sovereign. Finally,
they were absolved as if they were heretics&mdash;the harshness of the
archbishop reaching such a pitch that he wished to flog them, and
already held in his hand the rattan for doing this; but, after many
entreaties from their relatives, he refrained from carrying out this
threat. This inquisitional act being finished, the archbishop entered
the church with them, and, seated on his chair while they stood, he
delivered a speech in which he treated them, and the religious orders
that recognized them as ecclesiastical rulers, as if they were
heretics&mdash;although the Dominican fathers, who also had thus
recognized them, escaped from this. Those who were most offended were
the Theatins; and although they are now silent, one may be sure that
they are gathering up their stones. Thus ended this act, which grieved
the hearts of all; and on the following day the archbishop commanded
that they should go to the convent of Santo Domingo to sing a mass, as
a thanksgiving for such absurd performances. It was sung by the
treasurer Valencia, assisted by his illustrious Lordship; and the
sermon was by the father vicar-general, Fray Bartolome
Marron&mdash;who, carried away by his fervent spirit, emptied his sack
of foolish ideas. Among other things, he declared (besides making many
threats) that the Order of St. Dominic was the sister of the clergy,
and in proof of this alleged that his convent was ruled by the
cathedral clock (although this was a matter generally known, and of no
great importance). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199">199</a>]</span></p>

<p>Don Juan de Vargas was excommunicated, and interdicted from entering
the church, but he was not posted as such. The archbishop would not
allow them to go to say mass in his house, without heeding the wretched
health of his wife, or his having so large a family&mdash;and he
suffered the more hardship, as he remained in his house on the
island.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4658src" href="#xd0e4658">77</a>
Besides, when he went out of his house he took with him, as always, his
trumpeter; this the archbishop could not endure, for it sounded ill to
the Dominicans. Accordingly, they notified him of an act that he should
not be accompanied with trumpets, because he was scandalizing those who
were weak in the faith&mdash;although it was a fact that such scandal
was not presented before either the weak or the great. With this,
Vargas undertook recourse to the royal Audiencia; and, the document
being drawn up, he sent it to the governor, with the request that it be
considered in the session of that court. His Lordship withheld it,
desiring to settle once for all with the archbishop that he should
recall the excommunication or interdict; but, this settlement being
somewhat delayed, his Lordship returned the petition to Don Juan, with
the message that he must have patience for a few days, while he would
make every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200">200</a>]</span>effort (as he did) to secure a settlement; but
that, if he should not accomplish it in that time, Don Juan should
avail himself of his right. During the four days, various arguments and
letters passed between his Lordship and the archbishop; and at the end
of that time the latter, urged by the diligent efforts of the governor,
consented to yield, but in the wrong direction; for he threatened Don
Juan de Vargas with being posted as publicly excommunicated, to the
great annoyance of his Lordship. Don Juan de Vargas did not resort a
second time to the royal tribunal; but instead he went to the
archbishop and demanded absolution. The prelate commanded him to go to
Father Marron and Father Verart, and ask their pardon, and to do what
they should order him to do. He did so, and they commanded him to go to
the provisor on the same errand; and the latter sent him to little
Caraballo, the dealer in fireworks. All this he fulfilled, even to
signing a letter for the king, in which he retracted all that he had
written against the Dominicans; in one word, he signed what they placed
before him, already written. We all supposed that he would be quickly
absolved, and he himself demanded this; but answer was made to him that
his illustrious Lordship would notify him of it, and of the time and
manner thereof. All this was to give time for the return from Cagayan
of the bishop of Troya, so that Don Juan should ask his pardon and
compensate him for the injuries which that prelate judged Don Juan had
inflicted on him. He came from Cagayan about Holy Week, and that time
passed without any mention of absolution, until, on Holy Saturday, the
archbishop going to give the Easter salutations to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>the governor, the
latter addressed him very fittingly&mdash;telling him that it seemed
very wrong that at a time when Christ our Lord suffered for men, and
not only pardoned but even excused those who were tormenting him, his
Lordship, who stood in the place of Christ, was incriminating Don Juan
de Vargas, and refusing to pardon him even after he had obeyed, in so
edifying a manner, all the commands that had been laid upon him,
although those commands were unjust, and ought not to be obeyed. This
was the substance of the discourse, which lasted more than an hour; and
they discussed therein the question of the absolution, with the warmth
which will be related.</p>

<p>The archbishop summoned an assembly, by means of the document which
I send you with this, full of contemptuous remarks about the royal
authority&mdash;as the paper itself shows, without further explanation.
The good old man is obliged to decide with the Troyan and his friars
what he has to do, and then seek the support of the religious orders.
For this conference a letter was written to the bishop of Sinopolis,
and the latter told the fireworks secretary his poor opinion of such
conferences; that if he must do what was there determined by the
friars, and if this was to be like the former conference&mdash;so many
black-gowns [<i>negritos</i>] crowding in, and, when one asked a
question, its stirring up fifteen hundred other things&mdash;it was
best to cease having such assemblies. The bishop remained at home, but
sent his written opinion that the archbishop ought to absolve Don Juan
de Vargas, and that privately. The Franciscans and Theatins did not
attend the conference, nor did they send their opinions&mdash;excusing
themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202">202</a>]</span>by letter, with various pretexts, which did not
taste like honey to him. The archbishop wrote to the guardian of St.
Francis an ill-tempered letter, threatening him with vengeance; but the
guardian was not asleep, nor did he forget the rule of
&ldquo;interrogation and reply,&rdquo; etc. At the said conference were
present the Troyan, the Augustinian and Recollect provincials, and the
two Dominicans Marron and Verart, the axletrees of the other cart;
these last and the Troyan said that poor Vargas could not be absolved.
Father Duque, the Augustinian provincial, declared that he could and
ought to be absolved, and that privately, saying: &ldquo;As for the
offences of Vargas, either they are or are not committed against the
faith; if they are against the faith, as is being assumed, they do not
belong to your illustrious Lordship or to us, and it is not allowable
to discuss them here.&rdquo; Verart sprang to his feet like a flash,
and began to argue with the Recollect. In such debates the entire
afternoon went by, without their reaching any decision. At the end of a
week the sentence was uttered, and Vargas was notified that for four
months he must do what follows: During the first month, he must go on
every feast-day to divine worship in the cathedral, clad in the
sackcloth robe of a penitent, and with a halter round his neck; and in
this guise, he must listen in public to mass. The second month, he must
do the same at the convent of San Domingo; the third month, at San
Gabriel; and the fourth, at Binondo&mdash;and this, when it had been
decided in the conference that he should be &ldquo;absolved
privately,&rdquo; which are the formal terms of the sentence! When he
was notified of this, he appealed from that decree to the court where
this matter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203">203</a>]</span>legally belonged;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4674src" href="#xd0e4674">78</a> but as all the bishops were
Dominicans, where could he go where they would not confirm his
sentence? Accordingly, Vargas came before the royal Audiencia, asking a
laymen&rsquo;s decree.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4677src" href=
"#xd0e4677">79</a> His petition was considered in the session of that
court, and [afterward] shown to the fiscal of his Majesty, who [at the
time] was absent, inspecting a Chinese ship. In this state (which is
not one of innocence) the affair remains at the time of this writing;
but if it shall be decided before the ship sails [for Acapulco] I will
write further.</p>

<p>I only omitted to state that the first sentence of the archbishop
was, that Vargas might choose between the punishment above described
and the following one (which is not to be talked about): He should
erect in the plaza, at his own expense, a scaffold or stage, and then
give notice that it was there; and the archbishop would go to absolve
him thereon. Vargas must go thither naked from the girdle upward,
wearing yellow hose, and carrying a green candle; and on the stage he
would be flogged. And in truth he deserved the lash, since, by not
sending to Espa&ntilde;a, as the royal Audiencia decided, the two
friars who made war on him, he finds himself today in so great
affliction, which also occasions the royal authority to be insulted as
never before has been seen in all the [Spanish] realm.</p>

<p>At this same time poor Don Juan de Vargas finds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>himself in the
fray of his residencia.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4689src" href=
"#xd0e4689">80</a> For this investigation the governor named, as
associates of the judge, his Majesty&rsquo;s accountant, Captain Don
Juan del Pozo Gattica, and Sargento-mayor Lucas Mateo de Urquiza. The
secret inquiry ended a week ago, but they have not made known the
findings therein, which are said to be favorable. Only the Dominican
fathers, in whom he trusted for this emergency, have aided him by
contributing [a document of] fifty-three sections, regarding his entire
life and character&mdash;many of these concerning the Zambals of
Playahonda, whom he had assigned to the Dominicans;<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e4695src" href="#xd0e4695">81</a> and the first section goes to
show that he &ldquo;lacked the chief qualifications of a
knight&rdquo;&mdash;the way in which they speak of him. The city,
through its attorney, made fifty-six charges against him; and among
these they demanded from him damages for the losses that this community
had suffered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205">205</a>]</span>from the return to port of the ship or galleon
&ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo;&mdash;because instead of ballast they placed
in it wax, and for fifteen hundred other articles that were included in
the lading of the ship. As soon as the secret inquiry was ended,
Admiral Faura was arrested in the fort, and Sargento-mayor Gallardo at
the entrance of the bastion; and all their goods were seized&mdash;but
not much of their property was found; if there had been, it would have
showed that they were fools, and certainly they are not of that sort.
All agree that six hundred thousand pesos would not suffice Don Juan de
Vargas for what they demand from him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4712src" href="#xd0e4712">82</a></p>

<p>In Camarines there are great controversies between the bishop and
the Franciscans, whose commissary, Fray Ysidro de la Madre de Dios,
made very sarcastic [<i>saladas</i>] remarks to the bishop who, it
seems, does not relish so much salt. The former acted so that the
bishop demanded from the royal Audiencia that they should send that
friar to Espa&ntilde;a. It is to be noticed that this good religious is
so devout that his friars, on account of his modest behavior, call him
&ldquo;the Theatin&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the Jesuit&rdquo;]; but
seeing himself accused on such a ground, he was furiously angry, going
so far as to tell the bishop that everything was going to destruction
since bishops so ignorant as his illustrious Lordship were appointed,
etc. The royal Audiencia made no answer to the bishop&rsquo;s demand,
except in general terms; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206">206</a>]</span>that religious has a well-established
reputation, and it is acknowledged that he has cause [for what he
says].</p>

<p>By a loyal decree the bishop of Troya was notified that he must
raise the censures that he had laid upon the alcaldes-mayor, the
collectors [of tribute], and the rest of the officers of justice
throughout the bishopric of Cagayan. Up to the time of this writing, he
has not replied; if he shall do so, I will add a note of it.</p>

<p>The royal court soon responded to the petition by Don Juan de
Vargas, by a royal decree which was sent to the archbishop, to the
effect that he should absolve Vargas <i lang="la">ad reincidentiam</i>,
and send them the acts. It was doubted whether the governor would sign
it, because he disliked lawsuits and controversies, and because this
was to decide the point at issue; but he signed it. The secretary of
the court went to make the decree known, and the good old man took the
document for the ceremony of kissing it and placing it on his
head&mdash;but, placing it in his breast, told the secretary that he
needed time to reply to it; that those gentlemen [of the Audiencia]
took their time for planning these decrees, and expected that he would
reply in haste; and that he must send him stamped paper for a reply.
The secretary replied that he had orders not to leave the royal decree
with the bishop, and that his illustrious Lordship could answer that he
heard it, and afterward reply by means of a long letter whatever he
chose; but the latter was obstinate,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4732src"
href="#xd0e4732">83</a> and refused to give back the decree, and told
him to wait for his answer. Since this will be actually made by Fray
Marron and Fray <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207">207</a>]</span>Verart, it will make much trouble. In fine, he
has, however, already explained extra-judicially his
intention&mdash;which is, that even if they cut off his head he will
not lower a shred of sail; and if he posts the governor and auditors on
the list of excommunicated persons, it will be [not only] what can be
demanded, but what they deserve. It is expected that the contest will
be renewed,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4740src" href="#xd0e4740">84</a>
and affairs point to nothing less.</p>

<p>The archbishop has now replied to the decree, and his answer was to
send a bunch, or <i lang="es">olla podrida</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4751src" href="#xd0e4751">85</a> of papers which he calls
&ldquo;acts.&rdquo; Regarding the absolution, he says therein that he
cannot absolve Don Juan de Vargas, since it is a matter which concerns
the Inquisition. The Audiencia held a session on the first of the
month, regarding the archbishop&rsquo;s reply; their conclusion has not
been made public.</p>

<p>A military council was held to deliberate upon the
re&euml;stablishment of [a fort at] Zamboanga, and all voted that this
should be accomplished. The city was informed of this, as a command of
his Majesty, in order that the citizens might aid the enterprise; but
they were of a contrary opinion, for reasons which it is said, are
frivolous. The truth is, according to report, that they do not like to
be exiled [there]. The governor demanded the opinion of the Theatins,
which they gave in accordance with that of the military council, very
energetically demolishing the reasons adduced by the city. The <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>whole
matter, it seems, is going before the royal Council. Manila, June 8,
1685.</p>
</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">Occurrences during the term of government of
Cruzalaegui</h3>

<p>1. With the publication in Manila of the coming of Admiral Don
Gabriel de Cruzalaegui in the ship &ldquo;Santa Rosa,&rdquo; to govern
these islands, was revealed the obligation which he brought from Mejico
to restore the archbishop.</p>

<p>2. Before the said governor arrived, the bishop of Troya published a
document with the title, &ldquo;Advice to those who come newly to these
islands, that they may not err in judgment regarding the banishment of
the archbishop.&rdquo; In this writing there were propositions opposed
to the Audiencia, the cabildo, and the royal decisions.</p>

<p>3. Reply was made to this by an anonymous writer, against whom Fray
Raimundo Verart came out with drawn sword, issuing a manifesto that was
full of assertions hostile to the royal jurisdiction and to the
cabildo.</p>

<p>4. The governor entered Manila on August 24, 1684. There was an
earthquake on that day, an unusual occurrence for that time; and soon
after he had passed through the Puerta Real the balcony fell, and with
it more than one hundred persons&mdash;of whom many were injured, some
died, and others were crippled.</p>

<p>5. The governor soon manifested the partiality that he felt for the
Dominicans, intriguing with Fray Francisco de Vargas and Fray Juan de
Yba&ntilde;ez, who had been sent out of the city by the royal
Audiencia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209">209</a>]</span>but had returned to it before the entry of the
said governor; he did the same with Verart and Marron, who had been
banished, but left their hiding-places and appeared [in the city] when
he entered it.</p>

<p>6. Under cover of the favor which the governor showed to the
Dominicans, they made impudent speeches in the pulpits against the
royal Audiencia and the cabildo; and they refused to join them in
public functions, regarding them as excommunicated. For the same
reason, they would not go to the procession for the publication of the
bull, even when they were commanded to do so by the commissary of the
Crusade.</p>

<p>7. The cabildo rendered account to the governor, in a very learned
document, of their government during the absence of the archbishop; the
Audiencia also made him a very suitable report of what they had done.
But the governor paid no attention to either of the two reports, in
order to carry his own point, the restitution of the archbishop.</p>

<p>8. The governor endeavored to influence the auditors at his will,
doing them some favors and making some approaches to them, which they,
faithful to their king, resisted. Not being able to subdue them by this
method, he arranged that a demand be contrived by means of Don Tomas de
Endaya and Don Francisco de Atienza (both of them regidors and
belonging to his faction), that the city should sign a letter of advice
to the governor, in which they should represent to him the difficulties
arising from the banishment of the archbishop, and the uneasiness of
the people occasioned by their uncertainty as to what would be done in
regard to the government of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210">210</a>]</span>the cabildo, etc.; and request his Lordship to
adopt such measures as should be most opportune to put an end to their
anxiety. Those of the governor&rsquo;s following signed this paper very
readily; those who follow the truth, reluctantly; and there was one who
refused to sign.</p>

<p>9. The governor consulted the religious orders upon this point, and
upon the excommunications which the Dominicans were [<i>word blotted in
MS.</i>]. The Society of Jesus excused themselves from responding to
such a consultation, because they observed the malicious design with
which it was asked. The Franciscans at first excused themselves, but
afterward answered in favor of the cabildo. The Augustinians were ready
to suit the pleasure of the governor, on account of being very intimate
with the Dominicans; and the same was done by the Recollects, who
follow the Augustinians in everything.</p>

<p>10. With the said opinions, obtained by pressure, the governor
ordered that the bishop of Troya should begin to rule the
archbishopric, under the protection of the governor. This he did, one
Sunday, which they fixed, October 22; and he was styled governor of the
archbishopric, and personally went about posting in the churches
certain edicts in which he summoned the entire cabildo to appear before
the ecclesiastical court within the next three days, under penalty of
being regarded as publicly excommunicated, to give satisfaction for
having arrogated to themselves the government; and on the same day he
took away Juan Gonzalez, who was a prisoner in his own house, and
carried him to [the convent of] San Agust&iacute;n; and to the persons
whom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211">211</a>]</span>he found there he intimated that they would
have this man as provisor.</p>

<p>11. This so violent mode of proceeding caused much disquiet in the
community; and if the cabildo, desiring to maintain the peace which the
bishop of Troya and his friars were disturbing, had not yielded, some
tumult among the people would have resulted, so great was their
excitement.</p>

<p>12. The ecclesiastical cabildo repaired to the governor in regard to
this case, and were coldly received by him. A session of the royal
Audiencia was held; the fiscal set forth the right of the cabildo, and
justified their government; but notwithstanding this the governor
declared himself for the bishop of Troya, and displayed the [written]
opinions mentioned above, with which he confirmed the former pretension
of restoring the archbishop.</p>

<p>13. During the four days while the sessions of the Audiencia lasted,
there were long debates in the palace, and much confusion among the
people. The governor talked loudly, and expressed opinions that the
cabildo must not govern. The fiscal stripped off his robe, indignant
that the royal patronage was not respected. During those days, no
receptor or court secretary was allowed to enter the session, so that
no testimony of the proceedings should be taken. The Dominican friars
[went] in crowds to the palace. Marcos Quintero, who is entirely for
them, had offered to the governor, it is said, to pay whatever fine he
might impose for this.</p>

<p>14. [The bishop of] Troya governed the archbishopric in the interval
before the archbishop was restored to his see. Endaya went on this
errand with a royal decree, obtained by the utmost violence, and <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>given very
reluctantly by the auditors, who were afraid, because the governor
intimidated them by the language he used. He received the archbishop
with [salvos of] artillery and muster of the troops.</p>

<p>15. The archbishop, instigated by his friars, began to take his
revenge on November 22 of the same year. He sent notifications to the
ecclesiastical cabildo, the religious orders, etc., of an act ordering
that they should not admit into their churches the master-of-camp Don
Juan de Vargas Hurtado, or the auditors, or many other persons and
military officers who had a share in his banishment, or in the
deportation of the Dominican provincial and other friars.</p>

<p>16. The cabildo wrote to the archbishop to inquire whether entrance
to the church should be denied to the auditors if they came in a body
as the Audiencia, as they go on communion days [<i>dias de tabla</i>];
and he replied that this should be done, in whatever manner they might
go to church. In consequence of this, the Audiencia did not attend at
two communion feasts; these were the commemoration of the blessed
sacrament in the cathedral, and the day of St. Andrew the Apostle.</p>

<p>17. The governor showed a desire to settle with the bishop his
relations with the Audiencia; and he arranged that on the sixth of
December all the auditors should be present together in the palace, and
that the archbishop should come to meet them, as if by chance, and talk
with them, and thus have a sort of absolution conferred&mdash;a mummery
[<i>mogiganga</i>] by which they could attend that day the feast of St.
Javier, which was celebrated at the church of the Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>18. All those proscribed in the archbishop&rsquo;s act went to ask
for absolution; and he commanded them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>to take oath that they would not
obey the ministers of the king in matters pertaining to ecclesiastical
persons. For others, the formula of the oath was, that they must swear
to observe the sacred canons. This proceeding caused great disquiet in
the minds of the citizens.</p>

<p>19. Some disturbances led to others. On the ninth of December
notification was served on the dean and four dignitaries of the
cabildo, with a canon, that they must be regarded as under censure as
irregular, for having assumed the government of the church, and for
having arrested Juan Gonzalez and Don Pablo de Aduna.</p>

<p>20. The cabildo found itself entirely defenseless against the
manifest anger of the archbishop, without power to appeal either to
[the ecclesiastical court of] Camarines&mdash;since its bishop, the
head of that court, was of the Dominican faction&mdash;or to [the court
of] Cagayan, since Troya was there; or to the Audiencia, since recourse
to that body was prohibited, and the governor did not wish to interfere
with the archbishop.</p>

<p>21. On the same day, the ninth of December, an edict of the
archbishop was posted in which were annulled the sacraments of penance
administered by the said prebends, and the licenses which they had
given for hearing confessions, preaching, etc.; <i>item</i>, the
marriages solemnized without the permission of his provisor, Juan
Gonzalez&mdash;and they rained down censures, excommunications, and
threats by the thousand, according to the fury of Father Verart, who
directed all these. By another edict, dated January 8, all the legal
causes and suits which had been tried before the cabildo and its
provisor were declared null and void. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214">214</a>]</span></p>

<p>22. The said measures produced innumerable perplexities. Soon
afterward, the archbishop attempted to deprive the said prebends of
their appointments; and to this end he held a conference with the
governor, proposing most unworthy persons in the place of those
prebends. This proposal was considered in the session of the Audiencia,
and censured as irregular and out of order; and it went no further.</p>

<p>23. The archbishop issued an act against the trumpet of Don Juan de
Vargas, commanding that he conduct himself as an excommunicated person.
Soon afterward (on February 10, 1685), he posted Don Juan on all the
church doors as publicly excommunicated. The latter had recourse to the
royal aid, and wrote an excellent document in his defense; but the
governor did nothing for him, and only commanded him to obey the
archbishop and be reconciled with him.</p>

<p>24. Seeing himself deprived of recourse, the poor gentleman did all
that he could to procure a reconciliation with the archbishop and the
Dominican friars. He was commanded to beg the pardon of all the
aggrieved parties, even from the most inferior lay brethren; and he did
this, at the cost of many rebuffs. After this, the archbishop obliged
him to swear, declare, and attest that when he sent the archbishop in a
vessel to his exile he had sent him away without supplies of everything
necessary, although this was manifestly false, for provision was made
as if for a royal person. Even when he had done what was demanded from
him, the archbishop would not even take his name from the list of
excommunicates, such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href=
"#pb215">215</a>]</span>was his hatred for Don Juan. <i lang="la">Ab
ira et odio et mala voluntate monachi dominici libera nos,
Domine.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e4836src" href=
"#xd0e4836">86</a></p>

<p>25. The archbishop claimed that the senior auditor, Doctor Don Diego
Calderon, should [not] be absolved from the censures which, the
archbishop informed him, he had incurred because of the demand which he
made, when he was fiscal, against Bishop Pal&uacute;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e4843src" href="#xd0e4843">87</a> who landed in these islands,
with whom the Dominicans had secret dealings. Calderon replied to the
archbishop, setting forth the reasons which induced him to act as he
did with Pal&uacute;; and for the time the archbishop desisted from his
intentions.</p>

<p>26. The prebends endured this persecution with incredible patience.
Again the governor wrote a letter, [endeavoring] to mediate in the
question of granting a dispensation [to the cabildo] for their
irregular government, and engaged the bishop of Sinopolis as his agent.
Yba&ntilde;ez went to the dean to tell him that all would be settled
according to his satisfaction, but this was nothing but a falsehood and
invention; for the dispensation<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4851src"
href="#xd0e4851">88</a> was conferred with the utmost ignominy for the
cabildo and prebends, for the greater glory and triumph of the
Dominicans, the managers of this scene-shifting.</p>

<p>27. They obliged the prebends to make certain declarations, which
were fraudulent and misleading, so that it was difficult not to blunder
in the replies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=
"#pb216">216</a>]</span>which were directed by Father Verart, the
mainspring of all these plots. They made the prebends take an oath; the
latter consented to this, and submitted to everything, in order to
extricate themselves from so much annoyance and to be free from enemies
so powerful and so persistent.</p>

<p>28. The archbishop commanded the prebends to make a statement of
detestation [of their errors], in which were contained things
prejudicial and inimical to the royal jurisdiction and prerogatives;
and others, complimenting the archbishop and his friars and various
private persons. On the same day a conference had been held in which it
was asked whether the said prebends were worthy of being dispensed; it
was decided that they were, because those who were following the
current with the archbishop were very influential, but those who were
more judicious and learned thought that there was no reason why the
said dispensation was necessary.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4863src"
href="#xd0e4863">89</a></p>

<p>29. On the following day the archbishop again declared the members
of the cabildo to be excommunicated, alleging that although the bishop
of Troya had absolved them, he had done so only <i lang="la">ad
reincidentiam</i>, for such time as the bishop should choose. In the
said act he also commanded that in the afternoon of the same day they
should go to the cathedral to receive absolution and dispensation; and
on the next day they must all go to the church of Santo Domingo, to
make amends to the friars for imagined injuries.</p>

<p>30. The function of the absolution and dispensation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>was celebrated
with the greatest publicity, and in a very marked, offensive, and
injurious manner. An enormous number of the lower class of people were
called in, from the neighboring villages&mdash;and especially from
Binondoc, which is a village in charge of the Dominicans; for that
purpose, the sermons which would occur that afternoon in some churches
were suppressed, so that all the people could go to see a performance
that would so exalt the Dominican fathers.</p>

<p>31. The prebends went to the church, ignorant of the measures taken
for exposing them to ignominy. They found two tribunals erected, one at
the church door, and the other inside, at the great altar; and there
was an enormous concourse of people. Of the religious orders, the
Dominicans were there in great numbers; from the colleges, only the
members of Santo Thomas [<i>Tomistas</i>]. The archbishop occupied his
judgment-seat at the door of the church, and at either side were his
beloved Juan Gonzalez and Aduna. He called the prebends and made them
kneel before him in order to be absolved, as if they were heretics. He
handled a ferule while the <i>Miserere</i> lasted, although he did not,
on account of the entreaties of those who were present, strike the
capitulars with it. Then he went inside the church, and after
performing other ceremonies, took his seat on the second platform,
where he made an address, in which he gave many and sharp stabs to
those who favored the cause of the cabildo; and after that the
performance came to an end, with much gossiping among the people, who
regarded these actions as revengeful.</p>

<p>32. The archbishop prepared a feast in order <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>to regale the prebends,
quite contrary to his usual manner and harsh temper; the prebends
attended it unwillingly, seeing that they had been treated like boys,
and that this banquet was only a device to shut their mouths. He made
them elect another secretary for that same cabildo&rsquo;s corporation,
and afterward inflicted punishment on him who was secretary while they
governed; this was a poor cleric, whom he declared excommunicated and
suspended,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4890src" href="#xd0e4890">90</a>
and seized his little property, for having acted officially in the
proceedings brought against Don Juan Gonzalez by the dean as
provisor.</p>

<p>33. Troya returned from Cagayan, where he had gone, on the pretext
of administering confirmations, during the time of these transactions.
There he deprived of their curacies, and loaded with censures,
Licentiate Diego de las Navas and Bachelor Diego de Espinosa
Mara&ntilde;on; and having sent them to Manila, he placed friars in
their stead. Afterward he imposed excommunications on the
alcaldes-mayor and collectors of tribute who might buy and sell goods
with the Indians of those provinces.</p>

<p>34. Don Juan de Vargas, after his name had been on the list of
excommunicates two months, and he had been interdicted for four months
from entrance into the churches, solicited absolution, by a petition to
the archbishop; the latter sent it to Troya, so that he might poison
it. Troya pushed Don Juan farther toward ruin, and&mdash;paying no
attention to the reasons which the said master-of-camp Vargas brought
forward as having influenced him to banish the archbishop, in behalf of
the prerogatives of the king our sovereign&mdash;he made answer
furiously, that Don Juan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219">219</a>]</span>must be absolved with publicity; and, although
the governor advised him, the bishop paid no heed to this.</p>

<p>35. At Lent in 1685, the archbishop suspended three fathers of the
Society, to whom the cabildo while it governed had given permission to
preach and hear confessions; he did this not only because of the
aversion which he had taken for the cabildo, but on account of the
enmity which he had always felt toward the Society. The governor
compelled two foreign ships to pay very exorbitant imposts, at which
they were greatly dissatisfied.</p>

<p>36. Don Juan de Vargas was not ready for absolution. The archbishop
called together the theologians, to tell him whether the absolution
should be given privately; this was decided in the affirmative by the
majority of votes, but the Dominicans opposed it. The archbishop, in
order to defeat the resolution, decreed that Vargas must first perform
the following penance: During an entire month, he must be present in
the cathedral, from morning until high mass, clothed in sackcloth and
in the garb of a penitent, with a halter round his neck; and for
another month he must, in the same manner, attend the church of Santo
Domingo; another, the hospital of San Gabriel; and another, the church
of Binondoc. Then, the said penance being accomplished, he would be
absolved by Domingo Diaz, a mestizo of infamous character. The said Don
Juan de Vargas appealed, but the appeal was not allowed him, and he
remains in the same condition up to the present time. <span class=

</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">Paragraphs of a letter written from Manila, June 15,
1685, by Auditor Don Pedro Sebastian de Bolivar y Mena to his agent at
Madrid, Don Diego Ortiz de Valdes.</h3>

<p>In this ship came as governor of these islands Don Gabriel de
Curuzalegui y Arriola, a knight of excellent abilities, very
disinterested, and intent on the service of his Majesty&mdash;whose
royal revenues from the department of customs, which were so impaired,
have been enormously increased, of which he will, I doubt not, send
statements to the Council. The trouble is, that this place is so
corrupt that, even though a very good man comes here, with the best
intentions, people make him fail in his duty. Even if I had not had a
letter from you for the purpose, he would show indignation against me.
For, having spoken to the governor at various times, and asked if you
had hinted anything about me, either personally or through Don Tomas,
he has replied that such was not the case; but this did not happen to
Don Diego de Viga, for he carried the recommendations of Don Tomas, and
therefore has a place in [the governor&rsquo;s]
affection&mdash;although he shows all kindness to me also, and I
endeavor to serve him as far as I can reasonably. As soon as this
knight arrived, he made strenuous efforts to secure the restoration of
the archbishop to his see&mdash;for which he made a proposition, or
offered his opinion, to the royal court, finding occasion for this in
one which the secular cabildo had offered on the same subject. And,
although, in the private conferences which he held with each one of us
upon this matter, it was represented to him that such a solution [of
the difficulty] was impossible&mdash;since account of it had been
rendered to his Majesty, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=
"#pb221">221</a>]</span>and the acts therein referred to him; and also
since the circumstances and facts which had given cause for the
archbishop&rsquo;s banishment still existed; and that no restitution
had been or would be made to the royal jurisdiction for the injury that
he had done it, nor had he offered any betterment in the
future&mdash;he nevertheless insisted that it must be done. And as here
there is no [opportunity for any] will, save that of a governor, since
he is absolute, we all had to acquiesce, under compulsion and pressure,
in the restitution of the archbishop&mdash;and not only that, but also
in accepting the bishop of Troya as governor <i>ad interim</i> until
his illustrious Lordship came back. As soon as the latter arrived, he
began to unsheathe the sword, against all the human race; for he
declared that all three of us auditors had incurred the
excommunications imposed by the bull of <i>Cena</i> [<i>Domini</i>; <i>
i.e.</i>, the Lord&rsquo;s Supper] and by the canon, commanding that we
should not be admitted into the churches. This we reported to the
governor, and reminded him of the inconveniences which, as we had
represented to him, would follow from such restitution; and he, while
acknowledging this, talked of availing himself of extrajudicial
measures to hinder those that were judicial; consequently we were
interdicted from the church for several days. At the end of that time,
he sent to summon me, on an occasion when I was alone in the Audiencia,
and told me that he had the matter settled; that the act [of
excommunication] should be recalled&mdash;with only [the stipulation]
that the archbishop should go to the palace at a time when we all were
there together with his Lordship; and that, the archbishop entering
with him, we should kiss his hand, and everything would remain <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>settled. I
informed my associates of this, and all agreed to it, provided that the
word &ldquo;absolution&rdquo; should not be used, because if it were,
all of us would leave the room; moreover, we supposed that Don Juan de
Vargas would be included in this act, for, as he had concurred with us,
as our president, it would be very proper that he should do the same as
we. I gave this reply to the governor, and he told me that as for what
concerned Don Juan de Vargas, he had already arranged it, and that for
this he was responsible. In accordance with this [agreement], we
assembled at the palace. The archbishop came, and we went forward to
receive him, making the obeisance due to the prelate; with that, the
prohibition was recalled, and we remained free to enter the churches.
But it was continued with Don Juan; and to this day his name remains on
the list of excommunicated persons. It is intended, as I understand,
that his absolution shall be made in public, with all the ancient
ceremonial forms.</p>

<p>He published an act declaring that all persons who had directed the
cabildo during his absence were under censure as irregular; and
annulling the marriages celebrated, the licenses given to confessors,
and the confessions that had been made to them, and whatever else had
been done during the time of his banishment. The prebends were regarded
as irregular for more than three months; at the end of that time he
erected a stage at the main doors of the holy cathedral church, and
thereon publicly absolved them&mdash;having previously published an
edict that at the said function should assemble all the Indians,
Sangleys, mestizos, and negroes of the neighboring villages, which
occasioned astonishing disturbances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223">223</a>]</span></p>

<p>All affairs thus remain as they were, and these vassals are without
any recourse, since they dare not interpose that plea before the
Audiencia, as it is so powerless to exercise its functions;
consequently, to state the case in few words, the archbishop does
whatever suits his whim, without there being any one to restrain
him.</p>

<p>These proceedings keep me in the utmost anxiety, as I fear that so
unreasonable an act as this restitution will be very ill received in
the Council, which will lose respect for the authorities here, as the
matter was pending in that body. Accordingly, and on account of what
may be carried to Espa&ntilde;a, I give you this information, so that
you may, if opportunity offers, make it known, as I dare not write to
the Council about it, for my letters may not be sent forward&mdash;as
happened to Don Juan de Vargas, while of the letters that were written
against him copies were sent to the Council. If this should occur
[now], it would result in ruining us all. Notwithstanding these
difficulties, I am on very good terms with the archbishop, so much so
that in any event, whatever I may do, they will stand up in my favor;
and they have even gone so far as to tell me that they are writing this
year to his Majesty, assuring him of my excellent mode of procedure,
and how incorrect was the information to the contrary. Your Grace will
inquire at the secretary&rsquo;s office, and let me know whether this
is really so; for one cannot trust in friars, and, in order that they
may not imagine that I distrust them, I have not asked them for the
letter, in order to send [a copy of it to you].</p>

<p>The viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a having appointed, in accordance
with the permission given him by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb224" href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>Council, Don Juan de Zalaeta, the
castellan of Acapulco, as judge of residencia for Don Juan de Vargas,
he came here and presented all his credentials in the royal
court&mdash;where, without any contention, it was ordered that they be
put into force and carried out. Among the despatches came a royal
decree forbidding this royal Audiencia from taking cognizance of
anything belonging to the said residencia; but, this being granted,
twelve days after its publication the said judge was challenged by the
city on account of the entire case. As he had not been declared to be
judge for that, but only an associate, the city hastened to the
Audiencia in order that this court might declare the said judge to be
thus challenged. Among other reasons that the city alleged for this
proceeding was the statement that in the port of Acapulco, the viceroy
having commissioned the said judge to seize the bales and merchandise
which were going in the ships on account of the said Don Juan de Vargas
and his servants and friends, the judge had not carried out the said
seizure, on account of fifty thousand pesos which they had given him.
Although it is certain that the reasons adduced were very forcible, the
Audiencia, recognizing the force of the inhibitory decree, declared
that they could not intermeddle by giving a decision on the said
challenge; and that the governor should appoint associates [<i lang=
"es">adjuntos</i>] for him, in order that they might continue the said
residencia with the said judge; and that the original documents
connected with the said challenge should be sent to the Council.
Although the residencia was prosecuted, the charges [against Vargas]
have not yet been published. It seems to me that it is being settled
very conformably to justice, although the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb225" href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>proceedings cannot fail to show
many defects on account of the judge&rsquo;s inexperience; for he is
not a learned man, and here the lawyers are very few, and the conduct
of [such] a case is exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>As soon as the city brought forward in the court the challenge
against the judge, Don Juan de Vargas challenged all three of us
auditors; and in the course of the proceedings I introduced a document
acknowledging myself as challenged; [I did this] not only on account of
what Don Juan de Vargas had done for me, but because it was a
brother-in-law of mine who was under residencia, and his advocate also
bore that relation to me. They must have had good reasons for not
regarding me as challenged, and so I had to vote. I give you
information of all this, in order that if any reparation be proposed
there, it may be in this; for I judge that the points and articles of
this residencia will cause the utmost embarrassment in the Council, and
that it will be necessary to command that it be taken again. I give
thanks to our Lord that it has not reached me; for it would cause me
the utmost injury and perplexity&mdash;partly on account of his wrong
acts, partly because those who had written unpleasant letters to the
Council now turn tail, and explain nothing. This, it may be, is
attributed to the judge, who is not to blame&mdash;for here there are
only false witnesses, now on one side and now on the other; and you
will confirm this information by what goes there, which you will not
fail to know. For it seems to me that in all the lands discovered [by
Spaniards] there is no country like this, or where its inhabitants are
so inconstant. Accordingly, I assert that here neither friendship nor
enmity is permanent; for if now, for example, some persons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>are my enemies,
and on that account my actions are pointed out in the Council, when
[the news of] my vindication&mdash;through this or that
accident&mdash;comes from there we become reconciled, and eat, as they
say, from one plate; and the same on the other side. It is useless,
therefore, to take notice of anything in this little edition of hell
[<i lang="es">abreviado infierno</i>].</p>

<p>I have no other request or greater desire than to leave this place;
and although (for since I arrived in these islands I have written to
you at every opportunity) I have sufficiently wearied you regarding
this, I cannot cease continuing [my efforts to go away]&mdash;without
urging any fixed and assigned place, or where or how it shall be
accomplished. For every day, Don Diego, I find myself more
disconsolate, and I would by this time be desperate if I could not
trust in the good opinion that I have of you; and therefore, hoping for
your protection and stationed at your feet, I entreat you with the
utmost earnestness [for a change in my position], without heeding
whether or not it be a promotion. For me the best promotion will be to
go away, wherever it may be; and if it cannot be accomplished in this
way, [please] endeavor to secure for me permission, for such time as
may seem proper to the Council, to pass over to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, in
accordance with what I wrote last year, as there was no room for either
of these expedients to secure my departure. I send a special power of
attorney for you to make in my name surrender and renunciation of this
post, for the causes and reasons which I will allege in the Council,
either personally or by my attorney; I do not do so now, on account of
the damage and risk which thus may be occasioned to me because I do not
desire a post in which there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>so much corruption as there is in this.
And more, I would almost rather go to get a living by some petition or
commission than to be auditor of Filipinas; and this, Don Diego, is the
truth. Here there is no liberty for anything; there is no authority, no
respect, and, above all, not an atom of profit. Then, what is such a
post good for? It is only fit for ruining honor and reputation, and for
this it is notorious. In case I shall get away from here by any of the
aforesaid ways, you will ask that a judge of residencia may be
appointed for me, so that he may take it before I shall go; for I do
not wish to leave behind these <i>sorrapas</i>. You will previously
challenge Don Diego de Viga and Don Esteban de la Fuente y Alanis; for
these two gentlemen, each in his own way, are very malicious, and have
very little affection for colleagues. I know them well, by experience
of what they have done to other persons; and I do not wish that they do
the same to me. It is also necessary to obtain for me a royal decree,
so that I may not be hindered by the governor or any one else, that all
the persons in my household, and those who came with me to these
islands, may return in my company; and that I may be assigned a small
room for storage of my provisions for the voyage. For here it is not
the same as in the north,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4955src" href=
"#xd0e4955">91</a> where there are general accommodations for the
passengers; but each one furnishes his own provisions; and, unless a
place is assigned in which these may go, the transportation charges
cost more than one thousand pesos; but, as those who ship bales pay for
them at the rate of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228">228</a>]</span>twelve and fifteen pesos, they have many
advantages [over the rest].</p>

<h3 class="normal">Extract from a letter written by Father Luis
Pimentel to Father Manuel Rodriguez, procurator-general of Indias, from
Manila, February 8, 1686.</h3>

<p>Don Juan de Vargas was excommunicated and placed on the public list
by Archbishop Pardo; he thereupon came before the Audiencia. That court
demanded that the archbishop show them his acts, which he did not do. A
royal decree was sent to him; he replied that he could not send the act
that he had issued against Don Juan de Vargas, since he had to send it
to a superior tribunal&mdash;that is, to the tribunal of the
Inquisition. The auditors sent him a second decree; he replied that he
was encumbered with affairs of more importance than those of Don Juan
de Vargas, and could not make [formal] answer. They sent a third one,
commanding him to send such answer; he replied that the doings of Don
Juan de Vargas were public and manifest, so that it was not necessary
to enact anything against him, and accordingly he had no documents to
send them. The secretary of the Audiencia notified him of the fourth
decree, and had orders to read it to the archbishop, but not to give it
to him, because the three former decrees had remained in his hands
without his making any answer. The secretary was told, however, that if
the archbishop should demand a certified copy, he should give him one
and bring back the royal decree; but the archbishop declared that if
the decree were not surrendered to him he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>would not answer it. As he did not
render obedience to the four decrees, his Majesty commanded, by his
royal decrees, that the archbishop should be declared banished from the
kingdoms. The governor went to talk with him, to start him, as they say
on the road; and it is said that he found him obstinate.</p>

<p>Now follows the fiction that they made arrangements, in order that
the governor might not consider himself obliged to undo what had been
done,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4973src" href="#xd0e4973">92</a> by
recalling the sentence of banishment, and bringing the archbishop to
Manila. They ordered that all the estates of this community should go
to entreat the governor that the archbishop should not be exiled; and
the same persons went on this errand who [afterward] bemired themselves
in causing the archbishop to return to Manila. These men went about
talking and declaiming to everyone in the community about the great
difficulties, both spiritual and temporal, which must follow from [the
banishment]; but in reality all these were fantastical, since there
would be no further difficulties than those which the governor
chose&mdash;as there were none when the archbishop was banished the
previous time;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4979src" href=
"#xd0e4979">93</a> for one would hardly believe how great is the hatred
that most persons feel toward the archbishop and his officials, and to
the Dominican friars. The Order of St. Francis was remiss in making
this request, but an auditor brought them to terms, as well as the
members of the cabildos, both ecclesiastical and secular. The most
difficult thing was to subdue the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>Jesuits. A bishop who was a great friend
of ours charged himself with this task, and easily persuaded the
vice-provincial and the consultors; but I always have been of opinion
that we ought to pursue an even course&mdash;for I immediately saw the
trick, and that he was setting a trap for us, as actually happened.
Finally the vice-provincial and another father went, because I excused
myself from going in company with the other orders. With them went Don
Fray Juan Duran, a religious of the Order of Mercy and bishop of
Sinopolis; it was he who in the name of all the orders made the
address, setting forth the serious difficulties that must ensue in
spiritual and temporal affairs. This petition being ended, the snare
began; the governor told them to draw up a paper in which they were to
set forth the causes that led them to make the request, and that all
the orders should sign it&mdash;which converted the petition into
advice, and he did the same with the other estates, even with the
military leaders.</p>

<p>The [preparation of the] paper which the orders were to sign was
entrusted to one of the bemired ones, the provincial of the Augustinian
Recollects; but what he wrote was so unsatisfactory that even the
bishop of Sinopolis&mdash;who was active in carrying on this affair for
the governor, on account of being his intimate friend&mdash;did not
like it; and the bishop himself therefore drew up the paper, which was
signed by all the orders except the Society. Ours preferred to make its
own answer, separately; we did so, and I send [a copy of it] with this.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">News since the year 1688</h3>

<p>1. It is asked that the contents of this document may be read
attentively; the writer asserts that it is not his intention that
corporal injury shall come to the guilty, but only that the truth may
be known and these many evils be set forth.</p>

<p>2. Early in January of the said year, very secret conferences were
held in the palace, in which Bobadilla, Atienza, and Cervantes took
part&mdash;all opposed to the auditors, to Zalaeta and Lezama, and to
Don Juan de Vargas. They began to favor the designs of the archbishop,
and the governor to act despotically, according to the dictation of
Verart.</p>

<p>3. The result of the said conferences was the imprisonment of
Zalaeta and Lezama, on the twenty-second of January. Their property was
sequestered, and with great cruelty their papers were seized; and they
were very closely confined in the fort. He<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e4996src" href="#xd0e4996">94</a> asked for a confessor from the
Society, but the governor would not grant this, only consenting that he
might confess to one of three fathers whom he designated; these were
Juan Gonzalez, Don Esteban Olmedo&mdash;adherents of himself and the
Dominicans&mdash;and Doctor Atienza, brother of the Atienza already
named.</p>

<p>4. Toledo denounced Don Juan Zalaeta, saying that he gave him a
pasquinade so that he could publish it, which was of the following
tenor: The governor was seated on a chair, with his favorites Endaya
and Verart at his side; at his feet lay the king, his head cut off, and
his hands disjointed. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232">232</a>]</span>picture explains the state of affairs, which is
expressed by the verses that appear below.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5003src" href="#xd0e5003">95</a></p>

<p>5. The cause of Lezama&rsquo;s imprisonment was a paper which they
attributed to him, although it was not known with certainty that he had
written it; and both tribunals proceeded against him&mdash;the
government with imprisonment and sequestration, the archbishop with
censures; the two powers agreed very well.</p>

<p>6. Guards were placed in the house of Lezama, <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>from which resulted some
extravagant remarks by Do&ntilde;a Josefa, the wife of Bolivar; and
these set in motion what will be hereafter related. The wife of Lezama
presented a document to the governor, asking for what reason her
husband had been imprisoned; he sent the paper to an
alcalde-in-ordinary. The said wife had recourse to the Audiencia, who
commanded the said alcalde to deliver up the documents under penalty of
five hundred pesos, but he resorted to the governor, who forbade him to
obey, and imposed a penalty of two thousand pesos if he should
surrender the documents.</p>

<p>7. On the same day the governor summoned the auditors to a session
and conference, and with language of anger and rage informed them that
the alcalde was proceeding by his orders in the said imprisonments, and
ever, that they were involved in the same charges. At this they were
struck with great fear, with good reason dreading the governor&rsquo;s
outrageous manner of proceeding; and to this fear that some calamity
would happen to them also were added the reports that were current of
the dungeons that were being prepared, of various persons whom he was
arresting and examining, etc.</p>

<p>8. The auditors, now terrorized, secretly retired one night to the
college of the Society of Jesus, and carried with them the fiscal, in
order to consult as to the measures of which they should avail
themselves to secure their persons from the tyranny of the governor,
and whether they should remain in the said college in order to
administer justice from that place, etc. They could not reach a
decision in the matter, and with the same secrecy they returned to
their houses; and afterward the fiscal sold them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span></p>

<p>9. The reasons for the governor&rsquo;s hatred against Don Diego de
Viga were: his having proposed that the ship which served for the
armada should make a voyage in the year 1686, which was contrary to the
governor&rsquo;s purposes; and his proposal in the Audiencia that a
consultation should be held with the governor in regard to a packet of
letters from the king which were said to have arrived, in which there
were decisions of the utmost importance&mdash;which letters, it is
supposed, the governor tried to hold back and conceal.</p>

<p>10. He entertained ill-will against Bolivar for having replied with
independence and decision to an act of which he was notified on the
part of the bishop, in which he threatened the auditor with fearful
excommunications and pecuniary fine, because the said auditor protected
the interests of the royal patronage in the suit which the Augustinians
brought against the Society in regard to the village of Jesus de la
Pe&ntilde;a, and challenged the jurisdiction of the said archbishop in
this case.</p>

<p>11. The governor<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5045src" href=
"#xd0e5045">96</a> set spies on the steps and actions of the auditors,
and seized a bit of paper, without signature, which Bolivar was sending
to Viga, in which he informed the latter that they could not trust the
fiscal, who had that very day taken dinner with the governor; and that
he presumed the fiscal had betrayed them, disclosing their consultation
above mentioned.</p>

<p>12. The governor conjured from this bit of <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb235" href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>paper many mysteries; he
arrested the page who carried it, and commanded that the fiscal be
summoned. He planned the exile of the auditors, with the seizure of
their property and papers&mdash;in all of which meddled Cervantes, who
was an enemy of the royal Audiencia, and known as such; and now was
elevated to be the favorite of the governor by the favor of the
Dominicans, in order to be judge in the most important lawsuits of this
commonwealth.</p>

<p>13. On February 7 of the said year, the day following the above
incident, they seized Don Diego de Viga, and conveyed him to Mariveles,
a village in charge of the Dominicans, where he stayed in a mean hut.
From that place he went to Lucban, a village belonging to the same
friars, where he remained in close confinement and lacking the
necessary comforts; they allowed him not even an Indian servant who had
remained with him. All this severity was practiced on him,
notwithstanding that (as was notorious) the said auditor was so
burdened with sickness and infirmities that in the judgment of
intelligent persons he could not hold out three months in Lucban. The
commandant shamefully treated a brother of the Society, who
accidentally passed through that place, because he gave the said
auditor a little linen and some paper, which the prisoner entreated for
the love of God&mdash;which it is said, was taken from him and sent to
the governor; and that sacrilegious man even had the brother sent there
a prisoner and in fetters.</p>

<p>14. On the same day and the following one, they searched for Bolivar
in various houses; for, when he learned what was being plotted against
them, he had concealed himself. They surrounded his house, with <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>a large
force of soldiers; and because Do&ntilde;a Josefa and her sister spoke
some saucy words, in regard to certain questions that were asked them,
they were banished with much severity, and conveyed to the village of
Abucay, a village in charge of the Dominicans.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5058src" href="#xd0e5058">97</a> Do&ntilde;a Josefa was sent
first, and afterward her sister Do&ntilde;a Ynes, on account of the
latter being very ill when they carried away her sister.</p>

<p>15. The governor learned that Don Pedro Bolivar was in the college
of the Society of Jesus, and availed himself of his good friend the
archbishop to remove the auditor from sanctuary. The archbishop readily
assented to whatever he demanded; indeed, he has left no stone unturned
to injure the Society of Jesus. They surrounded the college of the
Society with a great number of soldiers, within and without, who caused
the religious incredible vexations and troubles during the nine days
while this blockade lasted. The [archbishop&rsquo;s] provisor was on
hand to incite the soldiers and make mischief; and he notified the
rector of an act by the archbishop requiring him to surrender
Bolivar.</p>

<p>16. The city and all the religious orders, except that of St.
Dominic, showed great resentment at this performance and felt
exceedingly scandalized. The governor, as obstinate as Pharaoh, said
that he would not remove the blockade from the Society&rsquo;s house
until Bolivar should make his appearance, if it lasted a year; and that
he intended to destroy the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237">237</a>]</span>auditor. The latter, seeing the constraint and
uneasiness of the religious, and the obstinacy of the governor and the
archbishop, gave himself up of his own accord; and they took him away
from sanctuary in great haste, and carried him to the municipal
building; and afterward, near midnight, he was sent by boat to
Mariveles, with the same harshness which they had showed to Auditor
Viga.</p>

<p>17. The convenient pretext and imaginary reasons which they gave for
these seizures were that those auditors intended to depose the
governor, and hand over his office to General Zalaeta. It was proved
that this plan would not suit the actual condition of affairs, even in
the judgment of a man of mediocre ability, much less in that of the
auditors; and even if such a thing were intended, they would find it
impossible to secure the means for its execution, since all the
military leaders were of the governor&rsquo;s faction and opposed to
the auditors.</p>

<p>18. Crafty actions, intrigues, seizures, and severities were
employed with persons of various stations, in order to give some
semblance of proof to the above fantastic idea; and they terrorized
many persons to make them relate, if possible, what suited their
purpose, and no more. Some they tortured; others were left without food
for two or three days, and one they deprived of drink for seventeen
days. Most of the persons thus examined had little courage, and were
sons of fear, so they found it easy to tell lies; and if they were
under compulsion they would say that Judas and Mahoma were in
heaven.</p>

<p>19. The governor soon found himself embarrassed by the lack of an
Audiencia; he therefore formed one in his own way, which was thoroughly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href=
"#pb238">238</a>]</span>accommodated to his opinions. It was composed
thus: a fiscal so terrified and possessed by fear that, if he were
commanded to flog an image of Christ, apparently he would not hesitate
to do so; one Cervantes, as coadjutor to the fiscal, a young fellow of
malicious disposition and perverse inclinations, who not many years
before had been condemned to death; one Angulo, in everything a man
after Cervantes&rsquo;s own heart&mdash;young and of little
understanding; and of so little ability that neither when he was a
receptor of the Audiencia, nor now when filling the office of
attorney-general [<i>promotor-fiscal</i>], did he know what to do,
etc.</p>

<p>20. Among the papers of Zalaeta was found one which was imputed to
the cantor Herrera, in which he spoke ill of Endaya; and on this
account the archbishop demanded aid from the governor, seized
Herrera,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5080src" href="#xd0e5080">98</a> and
placed him in the fort&mdash;treating him with ignominy unusual for [a
member of] the cabildo, placing him under the guard of secular
officials, and treating him like a highwayman. Yet the said archbishop
had previously favored him, and regarded lightly other offenses of
his&mdash;for no other reason than because Herrera had, to please the
archbishop and his friars, drawn up documents expressing in positive
terms, detestation of appeals to the royal Audiencia.</p>

<p>21. With these scandals and harsh measures, the city experienced
profound affliction; the minds of the people were appalled, and they
were so shut in by fears and terrors that no one considered himself
safe even in his own house. No one opened his lips, seeing the two
powers of the commonwealth thus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"
href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>jumbled together, and that in the greatest
calamities there was no recourse except to God. The inhabitants could
not communicate with one another, without criticism; nor was it even
lawful to breathe, since rigorous scrutiny was made of the most
trifling acts.</p>

<p>22. Great were the calamities which at this time came unexpectedly
upon this commonwealth&mdash;epidemics, famines, vessels returning to
port, [attacks by] enemies, losses of vessels. The governor the more
pretended that his conduct was influenced by an imaginary conspiracy;
for on the night of Holy Thursday, when he went to visit the stations
[of the cross], a multitude of soldiers went with him as escort,
besides his usual guard, and he was accompanied by the personages who
were in league with him.</p>

<p>23. Royal decrees were despatched against the preachers who
zealously proclaimed from the pulpits the arbitrary and malicious
character of the recent acts, and the Dominicans alone had the
privilege to utter whatever absurdities they pleased in the pulpits.
There is no counterpart to the satire against the Society which a
[father from] Santo Tomas preached one day.</p>

<p>24. Recourse to the royal Audiencia was entirely barred, as was seen
in the case of Don Juan de Vargas, who thus far had been posted on the
list of excommunicates, and all persons who held intercourse with him
threatened with punishment. Tardiness and delay followed him until the
fourth decree [was issued] in regard to his absolution, and it had no
result&mdash;as little carried out as was the king&rsquo;s decree which
he issued in regard to the banishment of the archbishop. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240">240</a>]</span></p>

<p>25. In Cagayan Fray Raimundo de Rosa killed Fray Juan Zambrano, his
vicar and superior; but the archbishop has not made any demonstration
[of displeasure], although he has so often done so in the more venial
offenses of the clerics. The Order of St. Dominic has honored the
Dominicans who were most rebellious against the king with the best
offices in the provincial chapter; and those of their following, like
Aduna, Gonzalez, Carballo, Cervantes, and others, are now in high
favor, although they are hostile to the prerogatives of his
Majesty.</p>

<p>26. No authentic statement of the evil deeds of these years can be
sent to the court; for the scriveners are intimidated and will not give
official statements of anything of what occurs, except what may be in
favor of the governor and the archbishop. <i>Item</i>, [this] is
written in much distrust and fear, on account of the numerous spies who
go about prying into and noting everything that is done. One notary is
in prison on account of a statement that he drew up; and another is in
exile.</p>

<p>27. The governor causes many scandals in the matter of chastity, not
sparing any woman, whatever may be her rank or condition; and he keeps
some worthless women who serve as procuresses for conveying to him
those whose society will give him most pleasure. In this scandal the
zeal of neither the archbishop nor his friars is active.</p>

<p>28. The governor will hinder the voyage of the ship to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, on account of the fabulous ships which, it is reported,
have been seen, according to the statement of an Indian, although there
is no confirmation of such news. The great amount that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>was spent in the
despatch of the armada, as the capitana of which the ship &ldquo;Santo
Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; sailed, without having the desired result; the
malicious purpose with which the said despatch was conducted, on
account of his having had information by way of Yndia which caused this
government to hasten.</p>

<p>29. As the archbishop would not absolve Don Juan de Vargas, the
Audiencia again decided to banish him; but the governor kept the royal
decree signed and sealed, without being willing that it be put into
execution. Instead, he joined with the bishop of Sinopolis to convoke
the religious orders, planning that they demand that he be not
banished. An inquiry was made among his partisans, who swore that they
knew nothing of it, and had not imagined it.</p>

<p>30. The archbishop prevented the confirmation of three prebends
which his Majesty had presented&mdash;to Don Francisco Gutierrez
Briceno, Bachelor Domingo de Valencia, and Doctor Pedro de Silva; the
first-named for cantor, the second for schoolmaster, the third for
treasurer. He refused to give them canonical installation, because they
are not among his admirers; and the last two are graduates from the
university of the Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>31. The Augustinians, in alliance with the archbishop and his
friars, brought suit against the Society in regard to the
administration of Jesus de la Pe&ntilde;a, or Mariquina. The numerous
disputes [<i lang="es">dares et tomares</i>] which have occurred in
this lawsuit, and the great eagerness with which the archbishop has
tried to favor the Augustinians; and finally, against all the right
that the Society had to such ministry&mdash;by <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>royal decree, by permission
from Se&ntilde;or Arce, and by permit of the vice-patron, etc.&mdash;he
has despoiled them of it with violence, and by the aid which the
governor allowed him for tearing down and demolishing the church of the
said fathers; and he has adjudged it to the Augustinians, because the
hatred and aversion which he has to the said order [of the Jesuits] is
implacable.</p>

<p>32. The archbishop mortified the religious of St. Francis; on
account of regarding them as favorable to the royal patronage, he
forbade them [to celebrate] the feast of the tears of that saint, and
he has not granted them many permissions which they asked from him. He
deprived them of the celebration of the feast of the Conception in the
jail; and finally, on the day of St. Stephen the protomartyr, he gave
them his congratulations on that feast by causing to be read an edict
against them, in which he suspended their licenses to hear confessions
and preach. All this caused great uneasiness in the minds of the
people, and gave just cause for the murmur against the said archbishop
that he had, by the measures here related, undertaken to revenge
himself on all those persons who, as he fancied, had taken part in his
exile, or had in any way approved it.</p>

<p>33. They attempt to absolve Auditor Calderon in the hour of death in
what he replied, and what the Dominicans did, and how the governor
pretended not to notice it. It seems as if the governor had come to the
islands for nothing else than to encourage the Dominicans in their
rebellious acts, to trample on the laws, to abolish recourse to the
royal Audiencia, to sow dissension, to be a tyrant, to disturb the
peace, and to enable the archbishop to secure whatever he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>wishes, even
though he imposes so grievous a captivity on the commonwealth.<a class=

<h3 class="normal">Felipe Pardo as archbishop</h3>

<p>[The Dominican side of this controversy is related by Salazar, one
of the official historians of that order, in his <i>Hist. Sant.
Rosario</i>, pp. 490&ndash;513 (chapters xviii&ndash;xxi); as this
account is long, it is presented here partly in full translation,
partly in synopsis.]</p>

<p>On the fourth day of August in the year 1677, dedicated to our
glorious patriarch St. Dominic, a royal decree was received in Manila
in which our Catholic monarch Don Carlos II appointed for archbishop of
Manila father Fray Felipe Pardo&mdash;who that year had completed his
second provincialate and now was filling the post of commissary of the
Holy Office. In the latter office he had given, before this second
provincialate, such proofs of good judgment that report of his
abilities had reached Madrid; and these alone, without any other
backing, had procured for him so high a dignity. The choice of him [as
bishop] was received in this community with universal acclamation and
applause, on account of the esteem that was merited by his abilities,
accredited by the experience that all had of his success and discretion
in government&mdash;not only in the two provincialates which he had
obtained, but also, as I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244">244</a>]</span>have indicated, in the commissariat of the
Inquisition; all therefore confidently expected in him a prelate
discreet and accomplished in all respects. Our father Fray Felipe Pardo
alone, distrustful of his suitability for that office&mdash;either on
account of his sixty-seven years of age, or in view of the difficulty
of the task&mdash;was greatly perplexed about accepting it. Indeed, it
was necessary at the end of two months, to make requisition on him, in
accordance with the rules established by the councils regarding
immediate acceptance by those thus appointed, under penalty of the
appointment being annulled, and the see being again declared vacant.
[He finally accepts (November 11 of that year) the dignity of
archbishop, and by special decree of the king enters on his duties
before being consecrated (which occurs on October 28, 1681), &ldquo;the
first archbishop who has governed this archbishopric without being
consecrated, and the first who has been consecrated in these
islands.&rdquo; Having spent thirty years in that country, he has much
knowledge of it and of its moral and social conditions, and much
experience in ecclesiastical government. &ldquo;He was very learned in
theology, whether speculative or practical, moral or scholastic; and
very expert in the despatch of business.&rdquo; He is aided in his
duties by Fray Raymundo Berart, very learned in canon and civil law,
who has left great opportunities of advancement in Espa&ntilde;a
&ldquo;to come to this poor province, to serve in the ministry of
souls&mdash;as he actually learned the Tagal language, and spent some
time in ministering to the Indians in the district of
Batan.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>The church of this archbishopric was in great need of reform, being
full of pernicious abuses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href=
"#pb245">245</a>]</span>which had been introduced by vicious practices,
shielded by permitted usage; so that now these alleged right of
possession, and that which was public and practiced by many was
regarded as lawful and allowable. False oaths were regarded, not
heeding this despite to the holy name of God, as a matter of kindness,
in exchange for not injuring another person by the denunciation of his
sins; and the oath which the judges take not to engage in trade was
regularly broken, without there being any one who had scruples in doing
so. The friendships and intimacies between the two sexes were so
prevalent that the excessive familiarity which was causing so many
scandals was already no occasion for them [<i>i.e.</i>, in public
opinion]. Executorships were hereditary, despoiling minors of their
property, and never rendering accounts [of those trusts]. Trading had
found its way among the ecclesiastics, notwithstanding the ordinance
[<i lang="es">constitucion</i>] of Clement IX recently published in
these islands; and at like pace all the vices gained sway, without the
least scruple or reparation, since established practice and custom had
now rendered those vices tolerated. [To remedy these evils, the
archbishop vigorously devotes his energies, notwithstanding his
age.]</p>

<p>The first action with which his illustrious Lordship began to carry
out this plan in the government of his archbishopric was, to reconcile
his cabildo with the royal Audiencia in a certain controversy between
them. This was, whether they should give the gospel to be kissed, not
only by the auditor who then provisionally held the government of these
islands (he was Don Francisco Mansilla), but also by his associate,
Doctor Don Diego Calderon. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>soon as the archbishop began to rule, he
settled this dispute with great sagacity, and much to the satisfaction
of both sides. Afterward another strife arose between the
ecclesiastical estate and the royal officials, because, at the time of
paying the former their stipends, these were curtailed on account of
the exemption from the mesada which had been conceded by his Holiness
to our Catholic king; and, the amount of what the ecclesiastics ought
to contribute on account of this privilege not being liquidated, the
official royal judges had acted illegally in the collection of the said
mesada, making themselves judges in their own cause by explaining the
bull of his Holiness without consenting to show it to the interested
parties, although the latter had several times demanded this. But our
archbishop, recognizing that what the royal officials were collecting
was excessive, and that it belonged to his office and dignity to
explain the doubts that might arise in the text of the apostolic bulls,
compelled the royal official judges, by dint of monitory decrees and
censures, to display that privilege; and when it was seen, it was found
that they had collected more than they should for several years past.
All this he made them restore, with considerable advantage to the
ecclesiastics, who were extremely grateful for the zealous activity of
his illustrious Lordship.</p>

<p>In almost all the Indias were being celebrated the masses which they
call &ldquo;masses for Christmas,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5158src" href="#xd0e5158">100</a> mingling with them certain
abuses which contaminated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href=
"#pb247">247</a>]</span>these masses with practices that were
superstitious, and contrary to the holy rites of the church. These were
tolerated under the cloak of devotion, and, although to some they
appeared mischievous, they did not dare to rebuke these rites in public
lest they excite against themselves the pious feelings of the common
people, and as this matter was one of those which belong to the zeal
and foresight of the ecclesiastical superiors. Finally the holy
Congregation of Rites, in consequence of the representations made by
zealous persons, on January 16 in the year 1677 declared the said
&ldquo;masses for Christmas&rdquo; to be not only opposed to the
rubrics, but also cause for scandals, and of superstitious nature, on
account of certain ballads that were interwoven with them, and other
like abuses. This decree of the Congregation arrived in these islands
in the year eighty; acting in conformity thereto, the archbishop
prohibited the said masses in his archbishopric. They were no longer
celebrated while his illustrious Lordship lived, although afterward
they were again established, but with some abatement&mdash;I know not
whether it was so everywhere&mdash;of the abuses which formerly were
customary. He also prohibited under severe penalties the practice of
bringing sick persons to the church to receive holy communion by way of
viaticum&mdash;a custom introduced into these islands from the infancy
of their Christian faith. It had never been entirely uprooted, although
ordinances against it had been issued by various zealous prelates in
their decrees, and by our Catholic monarchs in their royal
cedulas&mdash;commanding that the holy viaticum should be carried to
the houses of the sick, even though they were poor and of low estate,
as are the natives of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248">248</a>]</span>these islands. And because the previous
ordinances of the king our sovereign on this subject had not had the
desired effect, his Majesty again repeated his commands in a royal
decree of July 28, 1681, in which he charged our archbishop to banish
this abuse, the custom of carrying the sick to the church to receive
the holy viaticum, on account of the difficulties which might follow
from it. In accordance with this, our archbishop promulgated an edict
throughout his diocese, dated September 5, 1682, commanding that all
the parish priests should carry the viaticum to the sick, without
permitting them to be brought to the church; and although he received
from the parish priests entreaties and arguments on this point, his
illustrious Lordship did not listen to them, but courageously proceeded
in his holy undertaking.</p>

<p>Besides those exceedingly just measures, at the instance of the
royal Audiencia of these islands his illustrious Lordship promulgated
an edict&mdash;which was affixed to the doors of the churches, with
penalty of major excommunication&mdash;that all executors of wills must
within two months present before his tribunal the said wills, which had
not been inspected for fourteen years past; and so numerous were those
that were presented&mdash;not to mention others dating back to
forgotten times, which were not yet accomplished&mdash;that they gave
him work sufficient for several years. He issued other edicts and
monitory decrees in regard to the denunciation of various crimes, and
so many of these were continually disclosed that soon the
ecclesiastical tribunal was tilled with cases, and the numerous
officials in its employ could not make room for the legal proceedings
therein. Very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249">249</a>]</span>scandalous lives were revealed, and criminal
suits were begun; but these could not be prosecuted on account of
appeals and subterfuges which caused delay.</p>

<p>He who attempts to correct abuses and scandals finds it necessary to
equip himself with courage to meet the hostilities which he will
encounter; for abuses which have already become inveterate, and
scandals favored by indulgence, cannot be overcome without strenuous
efforts and repeated conflicts. Such was the case of a certain prebend
whom the predecessor of his illustrious Lordship had tried to correct,
but had never been able to do so on account of the support that the
delinquent received from a certain potent personage; accordingly the
archbishop&rsquo;s zeal contented itself with giving information of the
whole matter to the king our sovereign&mdash;who issued on this matter
a royal decree commanding the said archbishop to correct the scandalous
acts of that prebend, without fear or regard for any power. As this
royal decree arrived at Manila when the said archbishop was already
dead, the king our sovereign despatched another decree to our
archbishop-elect, Don Fray Felipe Pardo, very earnestly recommending to
him the correction of the transgressions of the said prebend.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e5180src" href="#xd0e5180">101</a> Notwithstanding the
activity of our archbishop, he could not end the proceedings in this
case for eight years, on account of the evasions of the culprit, and
the protection that he found in the officials of the royal Audiencia,
who at every step forbade our archbishop to take any further steps in
the prosecution of the suits, thus preventing his holy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>zeal from
successfully checking abuses and scandals.</p>

<p>This was made more plainly evident in the suit regarding another
ecclesiastic, the cura of Bigan, against whom the provisor appointed by
his illustrious Lordship (since the government of that bishopric
pertained to him) began to institute proceedings in a criminal suit, in
consequence of various denunciations and accusations. As the culprit
was on intimate terms with one of the auditors, the latter managed the
affair so dexterously that he caused the issue of a royal decree in
which the royal Audiencia commanded the archbishop to remove thence
[<i>i.e.</i>, from Vigan] the said provisor and oblige him to reside in
the city of Lalo all to the end that he should not proceed in the suit.
This measure was ineffectual, on account of the reply and
representations made by the archbishop; the provisor therefore
proceeded in his suit. The delinquent, finding himself in a tight
place, fled from Bigan and came to Manila; and, when he was arrested by
the archbishop for this flight, he demanded to be released on
bail&mdash;which his illustrious Lordship granted, by an act in which
he designated the city as the prisoner&rsquo;s bounds until his suit
should be ended. The culprit consented to this, thanking his
illustrious Lordship for this concession, and therewith submitting to
his tribunal. Affairs being in this condition, there came [in 1680],
with proprietary appointment as bishop-elect of Nueva Segovia, a
prebend of this holy church, who was an intimate friend of the culprit;
the latter, availing himself of this opportunity, undertook to shake
off the yoke of his illustrious Lordship&rsquo;s authority with an
appeal to the new bishop-elect&mdash;who, desiring to shelter the
other, demanded from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251">251</a>]</span>archbishop the acts [which he had issued]. As
his illustrious Lordship did not choose to furnish these&mdash;as this
suit was firmly established, by the consent of the delinquent himself,
in his metropolitan tribunal&mdash;the new bishop had recourse to the
royal Audiencia, asking them to command the archbishop to deliver the
acts. In virtue of the representation made by the new bishop, a royal
decree was despatched to Se&ntilde;or Pardo, in which he was commanded
to deliver the said acts to the bishop of Nueva Segovia; his
illustrious Lordship answered this by saying that the suit proceedings
therein were already established in his own tribunal by the delinquent
having accepted certain acts, and the law, therefore, afforded no
occasion for removing this suit and the proceedings therein from the
tribunal of the metropolitan, and restoring it to the culprit&rsquo;s
ordinary judge. His illustrious Lordship well knew that all these were
frivolous measures of delay, so that the case might not reach the point
of sentence, and the scandals should be left without restraint,
accordingly, although the second and the third royal decrees on this
matter were served upon him, he never consented to yield his rights, or
to acquiesce in the illegal commands laid upon him. For this cause the
officials of the royal Audiencia issued a fourth royal ordinance and
decree, condemning our archbishop to exile; this sentence was not
executed at the time, but with occasion of the new emergencies which
afterward arose, it was enforced with severity in the following
year.</p>

<p>Now that the archbishop was on bad terms with the royal Audiencia,
it was easy for the subordinates of his illustrious Lordship to have
recourse to this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252">252</a>]</span>supreme tribunal in order to challenge the
jurisdiction or appeal from the proceedings of the ecclesiastical
judge; and therefore royal decrees were continually emanating,
forbidding our archbishop to prosecute suits and proceedings, and
commanding him to deliver up the documents regarding them&mdash;by
which the course of the suits was hindered or delayed. His illustrious
Lordship answered these requisitions with so much clearness and proof
that the officials who issued them often considered themselves
vanquished, and did not follow up their efforts; and although they
resented what they called rebellion and audacity, they found his
opposition so justified by law that they did not dare to condemn him
for disobedience, no matter how much they chose to give his conduct
this title to outsiders&mdash;for these tribunals are not accustomed to
hear &ldquo;no&rdquo; to what they ordain in the name of the king our
sovereign. And knowing that the greater force of the replies and
representations of the archbishop depended on the assistance of the
consultor, father Fray Raymundo Berart, they strove to separate the
latter from his side, in order that his illustrious Lordship, destitute
of this aid, might be reduced with more blind submission to the decrees
and despatches of the royal Audiencia; and therefore that court issued
a mandate demanding and requiring our archbishop to remove from his
side Father Berart, and another to the same effect, addressed to our
provincial, to assign that father to a ministry among the Indians.
Suitable reply was made to both these decrees, without causing any
change, for the time, in the aspect of affairs&mdash;until, a new
occasion and emergency arising, they again insisted upon this point.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253">253</a>]</span></p>

<p>At the first foundation of Manila, only two parishes were formed for
the Spaniards&mdash;one for those who lived within the walls, and
another for those who lived outside the city, this latter being located
in a place where at that time most of them were wont to live. Afterward
that site appeared to them unsuitable for the conveniences of human
life, and so they went to live in another part of the city, and even on
the other side of the river which washes it. Consequently, they lived
very far from their parish church, and suffered great inconvenience in
attending it, because it was necessary for the administration of the
sacraments that the parish priest should cross the entire city, or make
the circuit of its walls, and finally he had to cross the river. As
this often had to be done at night, and at other times with the risk of
being drowned through the fury of the winds and waves, it was soon
evident how great difficulty there must be in giving prompt aid to the
sick&mdash;especially as the distance of the parish church was so great
that many parishioners lived half a legua from it. On this account the
burials also were solemnized with extreme inconvenience, and without
the processional order which is the custom of the church. Besides this,
it caused great confusion that the Spaniard who was owner of the house
should belong to the said parish, and the servants, whether Indians or
negroes, to that of the territory in which they happened to be. The
Spaniards also were ashamed of having a parish church so poor and in so
wretched a condition, for it was only a shelter of bamboos covered with
nipa. For these reasons the parishioners had at various times asked
that they might be joined to the parishes in which they lived; <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>and now, on
the occasion of a controversy which arose between the said cura and
another parish priest over the question, to which of them belonged [the
interment of] a deceased person, the Spaniards publicly appeared before
the ordinary, asking that he would assign the parish churches according
to the territories, in accordance with the custom throughout the
church. When this request was considered by his illustrious Lordship,
he gave information of it, and a copy of the petition, to the
vice-patron, to whom this matter pertained by law. The governor showed
this to the fiscal of his Majesty, who approved the desired change; and
with this decision the governor decreed that the parishes should be
divided according to the territories. He gave commission for this to
his illustrious Lordship, who divided and allotted the parishes in the
suburbs of Manila, with the system and order which are observed to this
day declaring that to each parish church belonged all the persons who
dwelt in its territory, whether Spaniards, Indians, or negroes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that this arrangement was in every way so judicious,
and had been made by the order of the vice-patron, with the approval
and advice of the auditor fiscal, the former cura of the Spaniards
considered it an injury and injustice, casting the blame for it all on
his illustrious Lordship; and, making common cause with the clergy, he
continued to disturb and disquiet their minds, until finally the
cabildo arrogated to itself authority, interposing a letter to his
illustrious Lordship that was very offensive to his dignity,
complaining of the severity of his government, in terms that libeled
his uprightness, and other expressions that were very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>unbecoming and
inappropriate to the dignity of a cabildo. Accordingly, for the sake of
their reputation, his illustrious Lordship was not willing to make the
document public, and he only showed it privately to the governor of
these islands&mdash;who was deeply irritated at what they had done, and
promised all his protection to the archbishop for correcting his
prebends. The archbishop did not choose to avail himself of this aid,
because he intended to bring them back to sober judgment by means of
kindness and gentle treatment. He therefore replied to his cabildo with
another pastoral letter, couched in affectionate terms, and full of
learning and paternal affection in which he gently admonished them to
recognize and correct their error. Again they wrote to his illustrious
Lordship, in more submissive tone, although it was apparently only to
pay him compliments; for almost on the same day they appeared before
the royal Audiencia with another document, making complaint against
their prelate of injuries, and saying that although they had
represented these to his illustrious Lordship, he had not answered them
to the point. The effect of this petition was, that the royal Audiencia
issued new commands, not only to the archbishop but to the father
provincial of this province, that father Fray Raymundo Berart (of whom
the cabildo bitterly complained) must leave his association with his
illustrious Lordship, and depart to the ministries among the Indians;
this was carried out (at the instance of the father himself), in order
to wreak the wrath of those who were in power. On this occasion the
royal Audiencia also ordered that a secret investigation be made of the
lives and conduct of our religious, commencing with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>the archbishop;
and, although a beginning was made in the fabrication of this
information, the plan soon fell through on account of another and
public report which was made, by command of the archbishop, in favor of
the religious&mdash;in which their reputation was so well vindicated by
testimony that those who undertook to blacken it through the secret
inquiry were left confounded and abashed.</p>

<p>All these occurrences that we have mentioned were preludes and omens
of some outbreak; for the minds of the people were disquieted, and
jealousy of the archbishop was plainly evident on the part, not only of
the clergy, but of the secular government. They were eager for some
fresh opportunity to arise for them to take extreme measures at once
against the archbishop, or at least against the religious of this
province. This soon occurred, in a sermon that was preached in the
cathedral by a certain religious,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5209src"
href="#xd0e5209">102</a> in which he explained moral principles that
were pertinent to the disorders then prevailing. The auditors, who were
present, began to resent this; and one of them urged the governor to
send a message to his illustrious Lordship, asking him to order the
preacher to leave the pulpit. The governor did so, in fact: but he
himself assumed authority to do this, before his illustrious
Lordship&rsquo;s answer came, and ordered the preacher to stop his
sermon, and proceed with mass&mdash;an act extremely injurious to the
dignity of the archbishop, that in his own church, and before his eyes,
the governor (a secular official, too) should interfere to give
commands to the ministers of the church. But his illustrious Lordship
was obliged to overlook this, in order not to cause greater
disturbances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257">257</a>]</span>or expose his episcopal dignity to the insults
of those who had already, it appears, pronounced judgments in defiance
of the courts of the church, and were only awaiting an opportunity to
assail his jurisdiction and dignity. His illustrious Lordship did not
choose to afford this to them, at that time, although zeal stimulated
him to defend the honor of the mitre; for affairs were now in such
condition that he would [by doing so] cause more injury than
benefit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the tolerance and patience of the archbishop, on the
second day after the sermon sentence was passed in the royal Audiencia,
in accordance with the representations made by the ecclesiastical
cabildo, against the preacher, condemning him to imprisonment and to
banishment from these islands. This was carried out on the following
day; Villalba was arrested in his convent of Binondoc and conveyed
through the public streets, being finally placed on board a vessel, in
which he was sent to a remote island until the time should come for
embarking him for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. This was accomplished in due
time, with great injury and hardship to that religious, and not less
grief to the archbishop at seeing such dreadful disorders, and even his
zeal powerless to remedy them; for these disturbances had now reached
such a point, and his subordinates had now become so hard-hearted and
rebellious, that they had already lost their dread of [committing]
sacrilegious acts, and did not fear to lay violent hands on the persons
of ecclesiastics and religious. Accordingly, foreseeing from these acts
of violence that which might result to his own person if some new
occasion should arise, his prudence caused him to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>prepare
beforehand for what might occur in such an emergency, by an act which
he drew up with the utmost secrecy, dated on the twenty-second of the
same month of January in the year 1682. By this act he appointed, for
any such occasion, as governor of the archbishopric the illustrious Don
Fray Gines Barrientos, bishop of Troya and his own assistant; and made
other arrangements&mdash;which were mild and reasonable, and worthy of
his apostolic zeal, piety, and gentleness&mdash;that would tend to
quiet the disturbances which would arise from any such act of violence,
and to favor absolution from the censures which would necessarily be
incurred by persons who should commit such acts of irreverence. All
this was laid away and kept with great secrecy until the following
year, in which occurred the imprisonment of the archbishop.</p>

<p>These melancholy events did not daunt the fervent courage of his
illustrious Lordship; rather, with apostolic valor and zeal he
proceeded in the correction of evil deeds, notwithstanding that he had
reliable information that his case was already concluded in the royal
Audiencia and sentence of banishment pronounced against him. He was
continually menaced with the execution of this sentence, at every new
difficulty which might arise&mdash;in this being like the great pastor
Jesus Christ, who, the nearer He foresaw His arrest, so much the more
freely rebuked vices. It is true that our archbishop in order to give
place to wrath and avoid hostilities, judiciously dissimulated in some
points which concerned his person or his privileges&mdash;for many were
the incivilities shown to him at every turn by the members of his
cabildo, who disregarded the customary forms of <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>politeness toward him; and
again, at critical moments in the controversies which arose between the
governor and the archbishop, the latter tried to yield what was his
right, or to overlook the lack of courtesy. But when offenses against
God, or attacks on his church or his episcopal dignity, came in his
way, his apostolic zeal did not allow him to overlook these&mdash;the
more, as he was needed by the aggrieved party on account of points of
justice intervening at the time. And of such character were the events
which occurred in the course of this year, and were the final incentive
to the acts of violence committed against his illustrious
Lordship&mdash;his zealous attempt to restrain certain ecclesiastics
from carrying on trade and traffic, to which they were greatly addicted
and devoted, in contravention of the pontifical decrees, especially of
a recent ordinance by Clement IX which prohibited the said commerce to
ecclesiastics; and likewise his having endeavored to compel an executor
to render an account of the estate which he had in his charge.</p>

<p>These were the chief motives for the arrest and banishment of our
archbishop; for, the same persons [<i>i.e.</i>, the Jesuits] being
concerned in both of those incidents, they again disturbed
people&rsquo;s minds, and stirred them up anew against his illustrious
Lordship. Past disputes seemed lulled, and affairs had been smoothed
over and adjusted, although anger against the firmness and activity of
his illustrious Lordship remained alive; and now the unusual character
of these incidents revived again the old complaints&mdash;those who
were parties in this affair uniting with those who were angry at what
had previously occurred. All joined in clamors against the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>archbishop,
treating him as turbulent, seditious, prejudiced, contumacious, and the
like; and from various speeches and conversations this opinion steadily
grew&mdash;all regarding as already certain and evident what originated
only in their mistaken prejudices, and with this basis easily reaching
a conclusion (as occurred with the majesty of Christ)&mdash;that it was
necessary to remove his illustrious Lordship from their midst, in order
to quiet the anxieties and disturbances which had grieved all the
estates of the commonwealth. So in the execution of this their
undertaking they did not observe the method and plan which is
prescribed in the laws for cases of so great importance&mdash;for there
was now no disobedience or contumacy to a second or third royal decree,
or interference with the royal patronage, or other like causes or
motives which could justify so audacious an act. And solely at hearing
the reply of his illustrious Lordship to two royal decrees, which at
the very same time were communicated to him in regard to different
matters&mdash;each one of these being the first one which was issued,
in both cases&mdash;all the officials of the royal Audiencia were so
irritated that immediately they proceeded to decree that the sentence
of banishment and [loss of] secular revenues, [<i lang=
"es">temporalidades</i>] which had been pronounced against his
illustrious Lordship in the preceding year, must be executed.</p>

<p>But the controversy of that year was now ended, and the parties now
reconciled, and therefore the cause of this action was not past but
present disputes. These were: that his illustrious Lordship had refused
to absolve a contumacious executor whose name he had posted as
excommunicate; and that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261">261</a>]</span>had replied to the royal decrees with apostolic
freedom and liberty&mdash;in both these acts displaying his constancy,
and zeal for maintaining his jurisdiction unimpaired. [On March 29,
1683, the Audiencia decree that the sentence of banishment be carried
out, but it is suspended for two days, that the necessary preparations
may be made secretly, in order to avoid disturbances like those
connected with Archbishop Guerrero&rsquo;s banishment. Pardo is
arrested at midnight, by a large body of officials and soldiers, and
immediately deported to Pangasin&aacute;n,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5236src" href="#xd0e5236">103</a> &ldquo;where the alcalde of that
province had strict orders to detain his illustrious Lordship there,
without allowing him to leave the provincial capital, or to perform any
act of jurisdiction<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5245src" href=
"#xd0e5245">104</a> or authority pertaining to his episcopal dignity,
or to correspond by letter with Manila.&rdquo; On the same day, various
persons are arrested as officials or near friends of the archbishop.
The provisor takes refuge in the Dominican convent, which is at once
surrounded by soldiers, an auditor threatening to demolish it with
artillery; at this, the provisor surrenders himself to the assailants,
but &ldquo;with certain precautions and securities,&rdquo; and is kept
under guard in his own house. Guards are also placed &ldquo;at the
bell-towers of certain churches, so that the bells might not be rung
for an interdict. All the household furniture and personal property
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262">262</a>]</span>[<i>espolio</i>] of the archbishop was
confiscated, and placed in the royal magazines&mdash;scrutiny being
first made of the most private papers of his illustrious Lordship,
without finding in them anything by which his enemies could calumniate
him.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>The bishop of Troya, Don Fray Gines Barrientos, who had been
appointed governor of the archbishopric by his illustrious Lordship for
this emergency, when he learned of the arrest of the archbishop
immediately presented to the cabildo the document appointing him; but
that body appealed to the royal Audiencia, and, with either their
expressed or their tacit approval, took possession of the government of
the archbishopric. They declared that the banishment of the archbishop
must be construed as the vacation of his see, although their action
might better be called a spiritual adultery&mdash;for, while the spouse
of this church was still living, the cabildo intruded their presence in
order to abuse her; and, although in reality they were but sons and
subjects, they had the audacity to occupy their father&rsquo;s
marriage-bed. At the head of this action was the dean, who with
dexterity and artifice lured on the rest to consent to this monstrous
deed; and because one, a racionero, would not consent, they thrust him
out of the chapter-room. Government by the cabildo having been
declared, it was an easy thing for this same dean to cause them to
appoint him as provisor; and in virtue of this fantastical jurisdiction
he went on undoing what had been done, and making
blunders&mdash;liberating all those who had been imprisoned by the
[ecclesiastical] tribunal,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5258src" href=
"#xd0e5258">105</a> giving permission to all <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb263" href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>the clerics to hear
confessions, absolving <i lang="la">ad cautelam</i> the excommunicated
(especially the executor [<i>i.e.</i>, Ortega] who had been publicly
posted), and promulgating an Octavian peace, like that of which the
prophet says, <i lang="la">Dicunt, &ldquo;pax, pax,&rdquo; et non erat
pax</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5277src" href=
"#xd0e5277">106</a></p>

<p>Among this confusion of affairs, the perplexity that existed in the
consciences of men was very noticeable: for some, endeavoring to
flatter those who were in power, gave their approval to all that these
had done, saying that they had not incurred any censure, and that the
jurisdiction of the cabildo was valid; but others, with more pious
judgment, regarded the said jurisdiction as either fanciful or
monstrous, and therefore felt scruples regarding all their
transactions&mdash;and not least in regard to intercourse with those
persons who had taken part in the arrest of the archbishop and other
ecclesiastics. This was the feeling of our religious, and therefore
they endeavored to refrain from intercourse with [those] secular
persons, that they might not incur danger from having communication
with excommunicated persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5282src" href=
"#xd0e5282">107</a> This withdrawal being resented <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>by the parties
concerned, they began to calumniate us as inciters of sedition, saying
that with our scruples we disturbed the peace which the cabildo and
their dean had striven to introduce in this community. In consequence
of this, the father provincial was notified, in the following year, of
a decree by the royal Audiencia in which he was charged and commanded
to banish three religious, the most prominent in his province, to the
kingdom of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and to send to the province of
Cagay&aacute;n two others, who were lecturers in theology&mdash;all
because the Audiencia had concluded that the said religious, as being
the most learned and serious, would persuade the rest to their own
opinion. The father provincial replied to this that the said religious
were not at all to blame, since he had ordered them to withdraw from
intercourse with those who were excommunicated;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5287src" href="#xd0e5287">108</a> then they pronounced against him
also sentence of banishment, which was executed with great severity on
the father provincial and his associate, accompanied by the acts of
violence which are mentioned in the first book.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5290src" href="#xd0e5290">109</a> ... The archbishop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>was very
contented in that place of his banishment, but so poor and needy in
temporal revenues that for his ordinary support he was confined to what
was given him for food by the religious who was minister in that
village; he therefore resided in the convent, like any private brother
in the order, and practiced the duties of [a member of] the community
as if he were a subordinate of the vicar of that house. But outside of
food and clothing he had nothing even for almsgiving; and therefore in
the letter that I have mentioned&mdash;written to a lay friend, a
citizen of this city of Manila&mdash;his illustrious Lordship asks
that, for the love of God, his friend will send him some rosaries,
medals, and like articles, so that he can make some return for the
little presents which the Indians give him. And by way of
acknowledgment for the hospitality which they had showed him in the
convent of Lingayen, he left in it his sole possession, a piece of the
wood of the holy cross&mdash;which he valued highly because it had been
sent to him by the supreme pontiff when the latter issued the bulls for
his appointment to this see. In this exile our archbishop remained
during a period of about twenty months, until at last a new opportunity
arose, by which he was restored to his see by the royal Audiencia.</p>

<p>In the year 1684 a new governor came to these islands, and as soon
as he entered upon his office he began, as an unprejudiced party, to
recognize the blind way in which action had been taken in these
proceedings, and the injuries and bad consequences which might be
feared if affairs continued in this state, especially as the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the cabildo was losing repute [<i lang=
"es">estando en opiniones</i>]. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>For the remedy of so many evils, he made
arrangements with the ministers of the royal Audiencia that the
archbishop should be restored to his see; and this was actually carried
out, by decree of that royal tribunal, in which the ministers of the
royal Audiencia admit that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction had been
snatched from the archbishop&mdash;as if this could be thus taken away,
and especially by lay and secular officials!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the decree for the restitution of the
archbishop had gone out from the royal Audiencia, it took much
persuasion to make him acquiesce in returning to his see. One reason
was, that he was not willing to return until his Holiness and the
Council should decide his cause; the other, that he saw the affairs of
his church in such a condition that it was almost impossible to set
them right. But finally, at the entreaties of good men, and as persons
very influential in this colony had gone to bring back his illustrious
Lordship, he made the decision to return to Manila, where he was
received with universal rejoicing and applause.... The holy pastor went
about, looking up his flock, and when he saw it so injured and
despoiled by the abuses, errors, and evil consequences which had been
occasioned by the usurping jurisdiction of the cabildo&mdash;and, above
all, by the censures in which so many were involved, affecting the
liberty of their consciences, with disregard for our holy mother the
Church&mdash;he undertook to procure the reconciliation of the accused
persons, inducing them first to acknowledge their errors. First of all,
through the intercession of the new governor absolution was given in
private to the auditors (who had been active in his arrest and in those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>of
other ecclesiastical persons), they humbling themselves to ask for
absolution with certain demonstrations of reverence. The members of his
cabildo he absolved in public, with all the customary preparations and
ceremonies; and the same thing was done with other persons, laymen, who
had been concerned in the said arrests&mdash;especially with the
preceding governor [<i>i.e.</i>, Vargas] the principal author of these
acts of violence, who, being now a private person, was not on the same
footing as the auditors, who were royal ministers and were actually
governing this commonwealth. There was much to overcome in this point,
in order that the said governor should humble himself; for he attempted
by various means and pretexts to exempt himself from the jurisdiction
of the archbishop&mdash;until, finding all paths barred, he was obliged
to subject himself to that prelate&rsquo;s correction, and to make the
necessary declarations in acknowledgement and detestation of his
errors. But at the time of imposing on him public penance he showed
that his repentance was feigned; for he never was willing to accept
that penance, or to submit to the commands of his illustrious Lordship.
On this account he had much to suffer&mdash;although the pain that he
had inflicted on the holy archbishop was incomparably greater than
this&mdash;seeing how rebellious was his heart, and how little regard
he paid to the censures.</p>

<p>The decision in the archbishop&rsquo;s cause from the courts of Roma
and Madrid could not arrive here as soon as it was desired; for those
of the party opposed to his illustrious Lordship had managed so well
that they seized all the mails in which anything was going that was
favorable to the archbishop, and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>only sent to those courts whatever
would contribute to his injury. Accordingly, the good name of that holy
prelate suffered greatly, and he was regarded as restless, seditious,
and disobedient to the royal ministers. But as there was no allegation
made on the side of his illustrious Lordship, and as the sentence that
would be just could not be pronounced without hearing both sides, the
Council were unwilling to settle so important a matter until all the
documents that were in favor of the archbishop should arrive there. And
in view of the allegations made on each side, although (it is said) the
royal Council had uttered the sentence against his illustrious
Lordship, the king our sovereign obliged them to revoke it, because at
Roma the sentence was of contrary tenor, and his Holiness earnestly
charged him to protect the cause of the Church, and to reflect very
carefully on all the events which had occurred in this case. In
consequence of these admonitions from his Holiness, it is said, our
most Catholic king Carlos II summoned the president of the Council of
the Indias, and gave him a severe and sharp rebuke for having declared
sentence against the archbishop&mdash;saying, among other things:
&ldquo;How you have deceived me!&rdquo; at which the said president was
so grieved that (according to report) he died on the third day after.
Thereupon these matters were again considered in the Council, with more
deliberation; and revoking the previous sentence, declared that all the
irregular measures enacted by this royal Audiencia were arbitrary and
illegal; they also removed from office all the auditors, for having
been concerned in this proceeding [<i>i.e.</i>, against the
archbishop]. In the same manner, the supreme pontiff <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>declared that all
those who had taken any part in the arrest and banishment of his
illustrious Lordship, and of the other ecclesiastics were publicly
excommunicated; and he made the archbishop his deputy judge, in order
to absolve them and reconcile them to the Church, after they should
render such satisfaction as, in the judgment of his illustrious
Lordship, was necessary. And to our archbishop he despatched an
apostolic letter, praising his fortitude in defending the
ecclesiastical immunity, exhorting him to continue with the same
courage in any future difficulties that he might encounter; and to
follow his own good example, acting with the same constancy that he had
previously displayed. [Here follows the Latin text of the brief; before
it arrives, Pardo has a fresh opportunity to follow its injunctions.]
Notwithstanding that all the affairs of this commonwealth were for the
time in peace, a new difficulty and occasion arose for the archbishop
to display his constancy in defense of the ecclesiastical immunity;
and, without fearing the threats of a new banishment, he showed himself
steadfast and brave in defending the privileges of his
jurisdiction&mdash;so much so, that the royal Audiencia again passed
sentence, of banishment anew, against his illustrious Lordship. They
would have carried this into execution, if it had not been for the
intercession of both cabildos (the ecclesiastical and the secular) and
the holy religious orders who all fell at the governor&rsquo;s feet,
entreating him not to take such a step, which would cause so great
injury to this commonwealth; with this the rigorous intention of his
Lordship was moderated, and this new blow was not inflicted.</p>

<p>Not for this did the valor of his illustrious Lordship <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>grow weak:
rather, in new emergencies (and many of these arose) he bore himself
with invincible courage; nor could his constancy be overcome, either by
regard for meritorious persons, or by dangers, perils, or threats. For
he had a heart and courage of steel (as may be gathered from his
letters written to the governor regarding various affairs) for
defending the rights of the Church&mdash;in these letters showing
fortitude like that of a St. Ambrose, of a St. John Chrysostom, and of
other like holy prelates. The holy archbishop was gentle as a lamb; and
all those who knew him affirm that he was merciful and affable; but in
matters touching the honor of God and the immunities and rights of His
Church he was transformed into a spirited lion, nor did he ever swerve
from his course or accept any [personal] advantage. And it seems that
God approved his apostolic zeal and the justness of his cause, by
coming to its defense with the exemplary punishments which He inflicted
on the enemies of the holy archbishop; so that, before the final
settlement of these disputes arrived from Roma and Madrid, He made
evident to the world his innocence, and the injustice of those who
persecuted him&mdash;taking just vengeance upon them by their miserable
and violent deaths, and other like calamities. These are not repeated
here, since they are already related at length in the eighteenth<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e5322src" href="#xd0e5322">110</a> chapter of
the preceding book; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271">271</a>]</span>God, almost by a miracle, preserved the life of
the holy archbishop so that he might before his death see his cause
concluded in his favor. Thus, if before all the world&mdash;or, to
speak more correctly, all hell&mdash;had conspired against him, at the
last he was able to see in his own day the union, in his favor and
defense, of the apostolic see on one hand, and the king our sovereign
with his royal Council on the other; and, besides, the Supreme Judge of
mortal men taking just vengeance on his enemies, by which the ministers
of the secular government were warned not to insult again the dignity
of the holy archbishop. And, although various collisions were not
lacking, they did not reach violence and hostilities; for every one
feared him, and regarded him as a holy man whom God assisted and
favored. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272">272</a>]</span></p>

<p>No other judgment is merited by the exemplary virtues of his
illustrious Lordship; for even those most blind and obstinate in their
prejudices were obliged to confess that the archbishop was a saintly
man&mdash;as was said by the auditor who went to arrest him, as has
been previously stated. The holy archbishop was much given to prayer
and meditation, and inclined to silence; he was modest and sedate in
his actions; and he was very watchful in whatever he did that all
should be ordered by the divine law&mdash;continually keeping in mind
the account that he must render to God of his ministry, a consideration
which frequently shines out through his letters and other documents
pertaining to the affairs of his high office. And this was the most
potent stimulus which constrained him to act with so much firmness in
the affairs pertaining to his ministry, as is noticeable in the letters
which he wrote thereon to the governor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>and are found in the authentic
relation of his acts. In eating he was always very sparing, not only
that he might observe religious abstinence, but because the delicate
condition of his stomach could not endure the least excess. The holy
archbishop lived in extreme poverty, behaving like the poorest
religious in regard to his table, clothing, bed, and everything else.
The province supplied his clothing, of rough, coarse frieze; and when a
garment was torn he himself mended it with his own hands, as the
members of his household have often seen. He employed the income of his
see in doing good to the poor, in aiding the missions of his diocese,
and in the adornment and repair of the churches. In the university of
Santo Thomas he endowed a chair of canonical law, on account of the
need in his church for training in this knowledge&mdash;to the end that
the ecclesiastics of this archbishop might in future be better
instructed in a subject so important for the management of the business
in the ecclesiastical court; but this foundation was not enough to be
effective, on account of unexpected accidents in the country.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e5345src" href="#xd0e5345">111</a></p>

<p>At last God chose to reward his labors, and his zeal in defense of
the Church; and thus, the previous storms calmed, God took him,
triumphant over impiety and injustice, from this life to that which is
eternal, with a holy and enviable death. This occurred on the last day
of December in the year 1689, when he was seventy-eight years of age,
most of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274">274</a>]</span>employed in the service of God our Lord.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e5355src" href="#xd0e5355">112</a> He was given
honorable burial at the steps of the clergy-house of our church of
Santo Domingo at Manila: and at his funeral were present the royal
Audiencia and the ecclesiastical and secular cabildos, all the
religious orders, and the rest of this community, all bitterly
sorrowing for the loss of such a pastor and prelate. Although his
government at first ran counter to many who were discontented, as he
seemed to them excessive in his rectitude, yet finally&mdash;his cause
justified, and the truth declared by so many tribunals; and his
blameless and holy life being seen [by all]&mdash;they hailed him
unanimously as a holy prelate, and an example worthy of imitation. And
even those who formerly regarded his rule as grievous now felt the lack
of such a father, and were grieved that they had not treated him with
more respect, their prejudice not having allowed them to know his
virtue and holiness. The cabildo was left with the government of the
cabildo, and transferred it to the bishop of Troya, Don Fray Gines
Barrientos, a member of our own order&mdash;not only to show their
affection for the deceased archbishop, but to <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb275" href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>make some amends for the
resistance which in past times they had made to his rule, when, at the
time of the banishment and exile of the archbishop, he had left the
bishop with appointment as his governor. Thus the cabildo made
acknowledgment of their past errors, for now were lacking in their
number the two prebends who had been the principal authors of that
resistance, and of all the incivilities shown to his illustrious
Lordship; and these two seditious persons being removed, the rest
professed filial reverence to the mitre and to his episcopal dignity.

be there had not quickly gone back to Manila to procure supplies for
the prelate, and returned at midnight with them to Mariveles. Diaz says

celebrated in their convent, the eighth day is devoted to thanksgiving
to Mary for the victories won by the Spaniards over the Dutch in 1646
(see our <span class="smallcaps">VOL. XXXV</span>), which were
attributed by the people to her miraculous aid. That fiesta of eight
days was apparently instituted in 1637, to celebrate the dissolution of
Collado&rsquo;s new congregation in Filipinas (see Santa Cruz, <i>ut

the appointment of the archbishop, sent a Dominican religious to the
convents to inform on his part their superiors that he gave, to those
confessors whom the said superiors should choose, his own authority and
right, so that they could absolve those persons who by command or
compulsion had taken part in the arrest of the archbishop from the
excommunication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e4225" href=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e4233src" id="xd0e4233">37</a></span> The interdict was not only
an ecclesiastical censure, but a penalty, entailing usually privation
of certain sacraments (save in cases of strict necessity), of all the
divine offices, and of church burial. All solemnities and public
festivals were suspended, except on the five great feasts of Christmas,
Easter, Pentecost, the Assumption of our Lady, and Corpus Christi. The
churches remained closed, the crucifix and statues veiled, the bells
and organ mute. This penalty might be general, over the whole city,
kingdom, or country; or merely particular, indicted on a named
corporation, see, church, or the like; again, it might be either local
or personal as to its effects. It might be imposed not only by a pope,
but by any competent church prelate, even by a bishop; and could apply
to any secular or ecclesiastical ruler (except of course the pope), to
a university or college, or to any body of clergy, regular or secular.
The earliest mention of a church interdict apparently is
Ferraris&rsquo;s allusion to one in the fourth century, of which,
however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e4235" href=
"#xd0e4235">173n</a>]</span>no details are available. In Frankish
chronicles, interdicts date from the sixth century, the first of these
being at Rouen, in 588; Bishop Pr&aelig;textatus having been murdered,
by order of Queen Fredegonda, while officiating in his own church, the
senior suffragan of that province, Leudovald of Bayeux, after
consultation with his fellow-bishops, laid all the churches of Rouen
under interdict until the assassin of the bishop should be discovered.
But prior to the eleventh century general interdicts are but rarely
mentioned in church history. It does not appear that there was any
ritual for either general or particular interdicts, apart from the
usually concomitant sentence of excommunication&mdash;which in former
ages itself entailed also interdict on the persons or places named in
the decree of penalty. The interdict was usually laid under conditions
that amendment, reparation, or restitution should atone for the wrong
done, at which the interdict would be lifted. According to present
church law, bishops are empowered, as delegates of the Holy See, to put
under interdict particular churches, and the like. See Moroni&rsquo;s

refuge in the Dominican convent, which was soon surrounded with armed
soldiers. At the advice of friends, Gonzalez gave himself up, and was
kept a close prisoner in his own house&mdash;&ldquo;guards being placed
there at his cost; and penalty was imposed of major excommunication and
500 pesos, if he should talk with any person outside.&rdquo; As soon as
Santo Domingo was blockaded, a decree of the Audiencia was made known
to all the convents that they must not ring the bells for an interdict.
To prevent this being done at Santo Domingo, &ldquo;they scaled the
convent through the hall of the Inquisition, which is above the main
entrance, and ten soldiers went up to the bell-tower.&rdquo; Next day,
the friars rang a small bell to call the people to mass, but the guards
would not allow any person to enter the church.</p>

that tribe. In 1676 the natives themselves asked for Dominican
teachers; some were sent, at which the Recollects complained, as an
intrusion on their field, and the Dominicans withdrew. In 1678 Juan de
Vargas came as governor, and, the Zambals again asking for Dominicans,
the governor induced the Recollects to accept Mindoro in lieu of
Zambales, making over the latter to the Dominican order. The latter
gave up these missions in 1712. (See <i>Rese&ntilde;a

Manila to be careful of what he wrote, since they feared that there
would be an inspection of the letters [in the mails]. He said that
since the return of Archbishop Pardo from banishment many arrests were
made: of the auditors, to whom they attributed a pasquinade which had
been posted; of negroes and Indians, servants and slaves, who were put
to the torture, in order that they might say what suited the
convenience [of the authorities]; and of ecclesiastics. Also, that a
pasquinade had been published, in which was represented the king,
stretched upon the ground, with the archbishop drawing off his
breeches; the governor was stabbing him with a dagger, or else cutting
off his head; Father Verart held him by the legs; and Andaya, who was
the minion, was helping them. It concluded with the verses:</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e5287src" id="xd0e5287">108</a></span> Salazar states (pp.
246&ndash;249) that the provincial Calderon was making his visitation
in Cagay&aacute;n at the time of Pardo&rsquo;s banishment; that on his
return to Manila (September, 1683) he called a council of the most
prominent Dominicans, and asked their opinions as to Pardo&rsquo;s
exile, the government by the cabildo, and their own duty toward those
concerned in these events; and that, in accordance with their decision,
he ordered all his friars to remain in their convents, and hold no
intercourse with those persons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e5290src" id="xd0e5290">109</a></span> Salazar here alludes to the
relation of all these ecclesiastical affairs in the first part of his
history, pp. 224&ndash;268. As it is so long and detailed, we have
preferred to use here the account which he gives in his biography of
Pardo; but have preserved, in our annotations, the most important and
interesting matter found in the former one.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e5322src" id="xd0e5322">110</a></span> Thus in the text, but it
should read &ldquo;forty-eighth.&rdquo; Salazar there relates how
Vargas, &ldquo;in the same year in which he banished the
archbishop,&rdquo; suffered the confiscation at Acapulco of all the
goods that he had shipped, &ldquo;with little credit to his reputation
and notable expense to his estate;&rdquo; and, as excommunicated by the
Church, Vargas had much to atone for and to suffer until his death. The
auditor Grimaldos died, soon after Pardo&rsquo;s banishment,
&ldquo;from a painful disease, in which the tongue with which he had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e5325" href=
"#xd0e5325">271n</a>]</span>spoken so much evil of his illustrious
Lordship became rotten, and the arm with which he had seized the
anointed of the Lord was withered.&rdquo; The auditor Viga, who went to
seize the Dominican provincial, Calderon, died in exile, in Cagayan,
without having consented to make his confession. He and his colleague
Bolivar had been sent there &ldquo;for a certain sedition which they
were plotting&rdquo; against Cruzalaegui. [Murillo Velarde says (fol.
344) that they were plotting to put Zalaeta in the governor&rsquo;s
place.] The wife of Bolivar &ldquo;died at Orion, impenitent, unwilling
to confess; when her husband heard of this, he performed condign
penitence for his sins, and publicly professed his detestation of his
transgressions, and thus he gained absolution from the
censures&mdash;but, returning from his exile, he died on the
way.&rdquo; Calderon &ldquo;also died very suddenly, although at the
hour of death he acknowledged his errors, and, to secure absolution
from the censures, made the usual profession of detestation.&rdquo; The
fiscal Alanis, &ldquo;the only one who experienced, while living, the
punishment from the king our sovereign which deprived of their offices
all the members of the royal Audiencia, died in Mexico in great poverty
and humiliation. The same fate befell the usurping dean,&rdquo; Miguel
Ortiz de Covarrubias. The cantor Figueroa was sentenced to degradation,
and to be delivered to the secular powers, &ldquo;which was afterward
commuted, for valid reasons, to perpetual banishment to the Marianas
Islands, where he ended his days in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd0e5327" href="#xd0e5327">272n</a>]</span>a thousand miseries.&rdquo;
The bishop of Cagayan died so suddenly that he could not be confessed
or absolved. The Jesuit Ortega died at sea, while en route to Madrid to
complain of Pardo; and although he received the viaticum, his mind was
so occupied, first and last, with accusations against the archbishop,
that he scandalized all the people in the ship. He died practically an
excommunicate, not having rendered his accounts for the executorship to
the archbishop, and having been absolved only by &ldquo;the usurping
Dean, who had no jurisdiction.&rdquo; &ldquo;The two soldiers who
carried out the father provincial died suddenly,&rdquo; being stabbed
to death, one by an infidel Chinese, the other on leaving the house of
his mistress. A man who wounded the provisor&mdash;in trying to murder
him; his name was Manuel Ortaf&aacute;n, and his wife had brought suit
against him for divorce, before the ecclesiastical tribunal (Diaz, <i>
Conquistas</i>, p. 766)&mdash;was sentenced to a short exile;
&ldquo;but God was not satisfied with that light punishment, and
accordingly took upon Himself vengeance against that man, afflicting
him with leprosy. This made him blind, and he finally reached the
utmost poverty, begging alms, with a boy to guide him, before the gates
of the convents.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="footnote">The spirit of this account is echoed&mdash;rather
curiously, for so late a date as 1891&mdash;in <i>Rese&ntilde;a
biogr&aacute;fica</i>, i, pp. 478&ndash;480.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=

Dominican province the sum of thirteen thousand pesos, to be used as
endowment for three chairs&mdash;law, medicine, and pharmacy&mdash;and
for some scholarships in Santo Tom&aacute;s; but the gift was declined,

of administering in (<i lang="es">Rese&ntilde;a biogr&aacute;fica</i>,

Cano, dated May 26, 1690, which says: &ldquo;On December 31, 1689, they
found Archbishop Pardo dead in his bed, <i>sine cruce et sine luce</i>,
without any sacrament, through the negligence of the people of his
household and his own confidence that he was to live a long time. For
some days all his body had been swollen, and he said that, thanks to
the Lord, he was gaining flesh. In the agonies of death, he called to
his servants, who were buried in sleep; no one heard him except Don
Juan de Cazorla, a cleric whom the archbishop kept a prisoner under his
own apartment, in fetters&mdash;who did not dare to go upstairs, lest
the archbishop should learn that his fetters were removed at night. The
prelate&rsquo;s body, wrapped in a loose gown, was carried to the house
where Auditor Grimaldos died; and from there to Santo Domingo, where
four days later it was buried.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="normal">Official Visitation by Valdivia</h2>

<div class="argument">
<p><i>An account of the occurrences in Manila on the occasion of the
arrival of the [royal] visitor, Don Francisco Campos de
Valdivia.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The said gentleman arrived in this city,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5373src" href="#xd0e5373">1</a> and on the same day he arrested
the fiscal, Don Esteban de la Puente y Alanis, seizing his goods. He
did the same with the notaries who had aided [the proceedings] against
the church, and with the military leaders&mdash;beginning with Don Juan
de Vargas, whom he left with guards in his own house. He made inquiries
into many facts which had gone forth on the part of the archbishop, and
many lies on the part of the Audiencia; many false statements in the
acts, and many other things by which people in Manila have been
undeceived regarding the just acts of the archbishop&mdash;who is
lauded by that visitor as upright, just, and holy; and who told all who
entered his house what was going on. He sent for the auditor Bolivar,
the only one of the four who was yet alive, who had been for another
reason banished to Cagayan; he was very repentant, according to report,
and was absolved with his solemn declarations&mdash;which were
published, by command of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277">277</a>]</span>archbishop, in all the pulpits of
Manila&mdash;expressing detestation of all his actions against the
church, in detail, up to his neglect to give aid for seizing the two
hundred or more bales belonging to the Society. He came with the
intention of dying, if it were necessary, in professing what he had
detested; but in Ylocos he died suddenly and without the sacraments,
while still near Pangasinan. Of his property and of that of Viga,
little or nothing has appeared.</p>

<p>The archbishop, seeing that all that he had done had pleased the
Council at Madrid and that at Roma, proceeded to lay aside his
scruples, by imposing and declaring an interdict against the church of
the Society, because the body of Auditor Grimaldos<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e5380src" href="#xd0e5380">2</a> reposed therein; and it was
kept closed from the eve of St. Ignatius&rsquo;s day for the space of
two months, until the conclusion of the lawsuit which the widow of the
said Grimaldos undertook to defend. They went to bring out the bones
for sentence, and these were so intermingled with others&mdash;they
say, it was done purposely or by artifice&mdash;that, in order not to
deprive of asylum those of the just, the bones of Grimaldos were left
in the church. It was blessed by the provisor with much solemnity, and
the doors were opened with a peal of bells and the universal joy.
Seeing this obstacle removed, on account of which that order were not
entering that church, the Catholic visitor spoke in reconciliation of
the two orders. At the first movement for peace, our order
[<i>i.e.</i>, the Dominican] declared that we desired it; and an
agreement was reached, all the Society repairing <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>to our convent on the
octave of the naval feast. Our provincial preached, the archbishop and
the Audiencia being present, and, I think, all Manila; for never was
seen such a crowd of people. In a few days, I think in that same week,
the feast of St. Ignatius was celebrated at the house of the Society;
it had not been done [at the proper time], since on the eve of that day
the church of the Society was placed under interdict. They had the same
large attendance; Father Cani<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5388src" href=
"#xd0e5388">3</a> preached, delivering a very spiritual and appropriate
sermon.</p>

<p>The archbishop, seeing that God was on his side, concluded to give a
public atonement to the church. In the courtyard of our church was
erected a stage, on which sat his illustrious Lordship and his cabildo;
one day at twelve o&rsquo;clock he laid an interdict throughout the
city, and on the following day were present all the culprits who had
concurred in violating the sacred persons and places&mdash;in a body,
without swords. They were absolved, with scourges [<i lang=
"es">varillas</i>] and <i lang="es">miserere</i>, and afterward his
illustrious Lordship restored them to the church. Then the next day a
procession was formed, accompanied by our Lady of the Rosary. For the
morrow there was a sermon, at which the governor and the city were
present; and in the afternoon, for the procession, all the Audiencia,
and the archbishop, etc.</p>

<p>The visitor sent Don Juan de Vargas to Pangasinan, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>as
excommunicated, since he had refused to submit to the sentence of his
illustrious Lordship; he is still there, and will remain there. He is
not going to Espa&ntilde;a, as he has not paid the amount to which he
was sentenced, which the visitor imposed upon him on account of the
residencia, in either silver or jewels; nor has he provided securities
for it. As for what concerns the residencia, the sum will be about one
hundred thousand pesos; in this decision the judge has, in the opinion
of all, proceeded most mercifully. The king&rsquo;s fiscal has been
banished to the island of Mariveles until the ship sails. The dean, Don
Miguel Ortiz de Cobarrubias, was involved in the libels that were
current last year, and in other matters against the archbishop, in
contravention of what he had decreed&mdash;as he said under oath when
they absolved him; accordingly he was arrested, and came out of prison
deprived of all ecclesiastical benefice. Our Fray Raimundo Bertist
[<i>i.e.</i>, Berart] also is going to Espa&ntilde;a. The schoolmaster,
Don Francisco Bri&ccedil;eno, was also deprived of all benefice on
account of his talk, and sentenced to perpetual seclusion in a convent,
from which he will not emerge unless he takes the vows; they say that
he is going into [the convent of] San Agustin. Very recently occurred
the fall of another member of the usurping cabildo, who in my opinion
was the worst of them; but he has escaped, through his crafty devices.
This is Don Jos&eacute; de Nava y Albiz, a racionero. They discovered
that some sessions of the cabildo had been held without informing the
new dean and canons, in opposition to his illustrious Lordship; also
they found a libel against the archbishop and our religious order. The
treasurer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href=
"#pb280">280</a>]</span>Valencia is also entangled in this matter. I do
not know how the affair will end; they will find themselves in bad
health if God preserves the archbishop.</p>

<p>Of the four dignitaries who came with the visitor, the two auditors
and the fiscal ranged themselves on the side of the governor, Don Juan
de Vargas; and when excommunication was laid on those who should have
intercourse with him, these persons went in and out, entirely
disregarding this, and causing great scandal. On this account the
visitor challenged them in a suit which the party of Vargas carried to
the Audiencia; and for the same reason the archbishop kept challenging
them in regard to ecclesiastical affairs. The fiscal married the widow
of the auditor Grimaldos. The other of those auditors&mdash;who is the
senior, and who is now governing&mdash;has much fear of God; and he is
all the more discreet and experienced for having been judge in
Burgos.</p>

<p>Among other calamities which this community has suffered, not the
least is the death of the governor, Don Gabriel de Curuzalegui, who
died April 27; for the political government depends on so many heads
that, as there is little concord among them and they are young men,
much trouble is feared.</p>

<p>In this year, toward the end of January, God sent us an epidemic of
influenza, very malignant, from which many children and old persons
died throughout the islands. The prominent persons who have died in
this city are: Don Francisco Beza, archdeacon of the cathedral;
Gallardo, who died suddenly in prison; Master Don Pablo de Aduna, Don
Francisco de Ocampo, and others. The governor died poor, and with many
debts&mdash;a proof of his upright <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>conduct. All feel that these islands have
not had [in that post] a man who was more disinterested, or who took
better care of the royal exchequer and the credit of the church. God
repaid him for this, since our king sent him several letters of thanks
for what he had accomplished&mdash;especially for having brought back
the archbishop to his see, and secured the removal of that monster, the
usurping government of the cabildo. The supreme pontiff wrote letters
to the archbishop, thanking him for what he had done and suffered, and
encouraging him for what was before him&mdash;saying that he himself is
imitating him, and using very affectionate terms.</p>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">Relation of events in Filipinas arising from the
coming of a visitor</h3>

<p>While all these islands were in the disconsolate and afflicted
condition of which an account was given last year, at the beginning of
July arrived the patache that was despatched from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
to bring the usual aid. It had a quick voyage, and in this vessel came
an entire Audiencia, and a visitor.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5421src"
href="#xd0e5421">4</a> The latter, disembarking at Bagatao, set out for
this city with the utmost speed, in a fragata belonging to the
alcalde-mayor of Leyte; and left orders in the patache that no one
should go ashore or write letters. He arrived at Manila very quickly,
and, landing at Cavite&mdash;where he was received with a salvo of
artillery&mdash;he went to the fort only. Having spent three-quarters
of an hour with Don Fernando, without going anywhere else, he continued
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>his
journey to this city, where he arrived at two o&rsquo;clock, and was
received with a salvo. He entered the coach of the governor, and going
from the fort of Santiago (by the postern gate of which he made his
entry), he reached the palace. On the plaza a body of troops had been
formed in order, who received him with a general salute of
arquebus-shots. He spent about an hour with the governor, at the time
making known to him only the commissions which he bore; meanwhile, the
faces of various persons expressed their wonder, for it began to be
rumored that whatever the archbishop and governor had done received the
visitor&rsquo;s entire approval. This statement was very soon
confirmed; for the said visitor, leaving the palace, asked for some
soldiers, and, riding in the coach, went first to the house of the
former governor, Don Juan de Vargas, but did not find him at home
because he was outside the city, in his country house, by order of the
governor. Leaving some guards there, and sending orders to Don Juan to
come within the city, the visitor went to the house of Don Pedro de
Bolivar; and when he asked for him and for his goods, he was told that
Don Pedro was banished, and confined in the fort at Cagayan, and his
goods had been confiscated and sold at public auction, by order of the
governor. The visitor proceeded thence to the house of Don Diego de
Calderon, and asking for him and for his goods, he was answered that
Don Diego was dead, and they did not know of any goods. He left that
place and went to the house of Don Diego de Viga, where he made the
same inquiry and answer was made that he had died in exile and prison
in Cagayan, and his goods also had been sold and confiscated <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>by the
governor. He finally proceeded to the house of the king&rsquo;s fiscal,
Don Esteban de la Fuente Alanis, whom he found at home in great fear
and perturbation. Immediately the visitor told him that he might regard
the house as his prison, and withdrawing him to an apartment, he seized
all Don Esteban&rsquo;s goods; by this time the afternoon was ended. On
the following day, Don Juan de Vargas, having returned to the city, was
promptly visited; and after a polite visit, he was told that he must
remain a prisoner in his own house, without leaving it, under a penalty
of one thousand ducados. On this day, it was published that all acts by
the royal Council in favor of the archbishop, the governor, and the
Dominicans were approved; that the auditors were suspended; that the
ex-governor was fined two thousand pesos; that all were summoned to
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;where they must await their sentence, in the
place that had been selected, twenty leguas distant from Mejico; and,
until a ship was ready, they were all banished from Manila to the same
places where the archbishop and the other Dominican religious had been
confined. They all were stupefied with fear, at hearing a decision so
unexpected; and those of the [archbishop&rsquo;s] following and
partners were full of satisfaction and triumph. Fear increased, and no
one felt any security in so fierce a storm, thinking that the said
visitor was in the place of the governor and the Dominicans. With this
it was expected that affairs would be in worse confusion than before,
and that the truth of events would be disguised and covered as those
personages might choose, with the fraudulent statements made in the
earlier accounts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284">284</a>]</span></p>

<p>The said visitor began his investigation, and for it demanded that
the court notaries should immediately surrender to him the original
documents of all the past disputes between the Audiencia and
archbishop, appeals [on the ground] of fuerza, and other causes; of
these he furnished a list. Then, in a few days, taking the declaration
of the said fiscal of the king, the visitor brought charges against
him, and commanded that he should go into banishment on the island of
Mariveles, and from that place should answer the charges. In the
intervening time while his cause was being prepared, a chaplain said
mass in his house; and the archbishop despatched a letter threatening
to place him on the public list of the excommunicated, unless he first
drew up and signed the same expressions of detestation that Don Pedro
de Bolivar had made, commanding that no priest should be allowed to say
mass for him; and thus was repaid his good services to his illustrious
Lordship during the entire term of the governor Don Gabriel. At the
beginning, Don Esteban resisted; but seeing that he had no human
recourse, and that, when he demanded counsel from the visitor, that
person gave him to understand that he must do it, he had to yield under
compulsion, and do what was commanded him. Another strong reason why he
consented to do it was, that he might not go to his destination as an
excommunicate; he went thither absolved, leaving the said act of
detestation dated and signed, to the pleasure and satisfaction of the
archbishop.</p>

<p>So frequent were now the visits of the reverend Verart, and so close
was his intimacy with the visitor, that he did not leave the
latter&rsquo;s house by day or even <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>by night&mdash;so that it was soon
rumored that the said Father Verart was the one who acted and took the
management in the inquiries, investigations, and charges which were
made in regard to those who were included therein by the worthy
visitor. This has been made more certain by time, not only by
information and occurrences which have come to our knowledge, but by
seeing how ignorant and unlearned the said visitor was; and if Verart
did not draw up the allegations and other documents, many will doubt
that the visitor could succeed in doing anything to advantage. We shall
see how the whole affair will turn out, and how thoroughly investigated
the truth as to affairs in these islands will go to the Council. The
governor, the archbishop, the visitor, and the Dominicans [will figure]
tied together by pairs, and Fray Raimundo Verart as the leader [<i
lang="es">corifeo</i>] of the dance.</p>

<p>When the patache reached the port, and the auditors this city,
various mails from his Majesty were opened, and it was found that the
remedy was worse than the disease itself; since the Dominicans and the
archbishop, like headlong furies, began a fierce tempest of vengeance
against all those who were not of their faction and at their disposal,
without heeding or fearing any one who might restrain them in whatever
they might attempt. Accordingly, they made the first attack, or rather
continued the old persecution, against the fathers of the Society
(using a pretext, in order to close our church for a long time), the
archbishop declaring that it had been profaned, meaning that in it was
interred [the body of] Don Cristobal Grimaldos&mdash;who, he said, had
died an excommunicate by having incurred that penalty in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>the
archbishop&rsquo;s banishment&mdash;although it was five years since he
had died, and only now for the first time did his illustrious Lordship
begin to have scruples, which he could not lay aside. In order to
conceal better his revengeful spirit against the Society, he waited
until the day of most publicity and greatest attendance [at our
church], which was the day of our great patriarch St. Ignatius;
choosing this day, he waited until the hour of nine, when the church
was full of people, including all the religious communities of this
city, and only the arrival of the royal Audiencia was awaited to begin
high mass for the saint. For that time and hour, then, his illustrious
Lordship reserved his scruples; and, sending two notaries, they
published and posted on the church door his edict, declaring the church
of the Society of Jesus to be polluted&mdash;declaring under penalty of
major excommunication, <i lang="la">lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</i>,
that no faithful Christian should attend divine worship in the said
church. All the people, therefore, were obliged to go out, and the
doors were locked for two months and two days, from July 31 to October
2; and, although Do&ntilde;a Manuela Barrientos, formerly the wife of
the said Se&ntilde;or Grimaldos, came out in our defense&mdash;proving
not only by the confessors who assisted him, but by the testimony of
other witnesses, that he had died with all the sacraments and with
great contrition&mdash;nothing of this was sufficient to prevent the
archbishop from pronouncing notices that he had died impenitent and
excommunicate. He therefore commanded that the bones should be exhumed,
for which purpose the provisor, Juan Gonzalez, went one afternoon,
October 2, with other officials and some negroes with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>spades, and
opened the tomb; but, finding many bones, and among them three skulls,
they had to leave these in their place, as they could not distinguish
which were those of the auditor Grimaldos. On the following day the
said provisor came to bless our church, and the gates were again
opened, to the great joy and consolation of the people.</p>

<p>At this time, when the archbishop was engaged in disinterring the
bones of the said auditor Grimaldos, the visitor&mdash;who had been
declared investigating judge for special suits and commissions
only&mdash;was going about in another direction, making his secret
inquiries about past affairs. In everything he proceeded greatly in
favor of the archbishop, governor, and Dominicans, but with general
complaints from all the witnesses, who said that the examiner had come
not to ascertain the truth, but to confirm the fraudulent and malicious
reports of the archbishop and the friars&mdash;for, as soon as they
said anything against the latter, they were immediately checked, and
what was set down in the document was moderated; but if it was anything
in favor of them, the examiner heard it at much length, and employed
his rhetoric to dilate upon it very extensively. He very soon gave
orders that Captain Lerma (who took the place of Armenta, the secretary
of the Audiencia, who was banished to Pangasinan) and Sargento-mayor
Juan Sanchez (who was secretary of that court in the time of the
controversies between the Audiencia and the archbishop) should enter
the fort as prisoners. Every day his friendship and intercourse with
the governor grew more and more intimate, so much so that not a night
passed when he did not inform the governor of all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>that he had
accomplished that day, praising himself for having gained control of
everything [<i lang="es">de hechar todo a su barda</i>]. This was seen
by what occurred in the country; and he took away life from whomever he
chose, as easily as if he had been a governor. It being necessary for
his investigation that Auditor Bolivar should come to this city, the
examiner demanded that he be brought from Cagayan, where he was at the
time; and the latter while coming, in good health, upon entering the
province of Pangasinan from that of Ylocos fell dead, from [drinking]
one cup of chocolate, without obtaining the sacraments. This rumor of
poisoning was so widely spread in all this region that the governor,
notwithstanding all his efforts, could not stop the mouths of all;
accordingly the worthy examiner was full of fear and dread lest they
should do as much more to him, and did all that the governor,
archbishop, and Dominicans desired&mdash;if before with some
concealment, from that day with entire publicity&mdash;calling the
archbishop a saintly old man.</p>

<p>The residencia of the ex-governor was published, and in the course
of it and of other investigations (all which were proceeding at the
same time) the goods of most of the prominent citizens of Manila were
seized and detained&mdash;some having incurred blame in certain charges
of the residencia, and others because they had been commanded by the
[former] royal Audiencia and its governor and captain-general, under
grave penalties in the decrees, to find and seize the Dominican
religious. Consequently the people were in great perplexity, not
knowing what was to be done; for it went ill with them if they obeyed
the king, and still worse if they did not obey. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>They showed the [former]
orders and decrees, but nothing availed them; consequently all went out
after several days of imprisonment (in which time died Sargento-mayor
Don Juan Gallardo), mulcted in amounts of three hundred, four hundred,
and even five hundred pesos [each].</p>

<p>At the beginning of the month of October, the examiner took greatly
to heart the establishment of peace between the Dominican fathers and
those of the Society, in which negotiation the governor and the
archbishop were active, since now the latter found no longer the means
for annoying us. The affair was very diligently conducted, but always
with the claim of advantages for the other side. The worthy man was
quite deceived, having been told that the Dominican fathers had only
broken off their former intercourse with our church inasmuch as it had
been polluted from the time when Auditor Grimaldos was interred in it;
but this was a great lie, and quite notorious, since, a year before the
said auditor died, since the controversy over the arms,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e5460src" href="#xd0e5460">5</a> they had ceased
intercourse [with us]. Notwithstanding all this, they always directed
their efforts to the end that the Society should yield; and, the octave
of the naval feast falling on the very day of St. Francis de Borgia, we
had to delay until the octave the feast and sermon for the saint, and
went in a body to the church. Great rejoicing was displayed in the
city; much artillery was fired; the [Dominican] provincial Marron
preached; the archbishop, governor, and Audiencia were present. <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>All this
was repeated on the day of the octave of St. Francis Borgia, when
Father Cani preached; and from that day the Dominican fathers and their
archbishop have displayed, at least externally, their former
friendliness.</p>

<p>A little while afterward, on the day of St. Peter [of] Alcantara,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e5467src" href="#xd0e5467">6</a> occurred the
most fearful earthquake that ever, according to report, was known in
these islands, the shocks being repeated at various times. The father
rector went to the archbishop to ask his permission to offer the act of
contrition, but he refused to allow it&mdash;saying that he had thought
of something else that was better, which was, to carry the Virgin of
the Rosary through the streets, all reciting the rosary aloud.
Moreover, in order to make peace with God and placate His just anger,
he commanded one day that a general interdict be rung, publishing as
excommunicated all those who had in any manner been concerned in the
banishment of his illustrious Lordship and the other Dominican
religious, and all the officers who had taken part in the blockade of
the convent of Santo Domingo. Afterward, having erected a scaffold or
stage in the courtyard of his convent, he published the
absolution&mdash;for which they went past him one by one to be
absolved, without sword or hat. In this were ranked all the <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>military
and officials of Manila&mdash;all solemnly swearing never again to take
action or render obedience for such occasions, even though the king
should command them to. All those who were absent were likewise
absolved, Don Juan de Vargas being excepted, <i lang="la">
nominatim</i>. This function was ended by the promise that with this
God would be placated, and the earth rendered quiet&mdash;although His
Divine Majesty, for [the ends of] His lofty judgments, continued the
incessant tremblings of the earth.</p>

<p>It seems that with this the tragedies were ended, all [the culprits]
absolved, and the earth blessed; but his illustrious Lordship and the
friars, recalling to mind the former preposterous attempt to change all
the [members of the] cabildo and arrange it according to their own
humor and taste, and seeing themselves masters of the field, without
any one remaining who could resist them, undertook to put that scheme
into execution, bringing against all the prebends such suits as they
pleased. Commencing with the dean, after a long imprisonment they
passed sentence on him that he should be deprived of his dignity and
should go to Espa&ntilde;a; and, being meanwhile suspended from office,
he should remain in Manila. Then they put in his place, and made dean,
the provisor Juan Gonzalez&mdash;a person of the qualifications that we
all know. Soon they attacked in the rear the good old archdeacon,
Doctor Francisco Deza, and brought against him a very infamous
complaint, entirely unworthy of his exemplary life and gray hairs, in
order to deprive him of his prebend. God chose, rather, to take him to
himself; but on the day when he died they seized all his goods, and
placed in the prebend the cura of Quiapo, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>Caraballo&mdash;a Visayan by
birth, and a notorious<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5482src" href=
"#xd0e5482">7</a> mestizo. By way of courtesy, they passed then to the
schoolmaster, Don Francisco Gutierrez; and, not finding any worse fault
than the report that he had spoken ill of his prelate, it was enough
for their purpose. After a long imprisonment, his sentence was
pronounced&mdash;the loss of his prebend, and perpetual seclusion in a
religious order, which he might choose; accordingly, he entered the
convent of San Agustin. Thus they had a position into which to thrust a
student from Santo Tomas, named Altamirano&mdash;of whom, when I say
that he is a nephew of Cervantes, there is nothing more to be added.
Another prebend, a racionero, named Don Jose de Nava, they got into
their clutches a little while ago&mdash;because it is known that he
wrote to his Majesty the excellent qualifications of those whom his
illustrious Lordship was placing in the cabildo, which are admirable
and undoubted&mdash;and seized all his goods. They are keeping him in
fetters, in a place where he does not even know whether it is day or
night, without [allowing him to] communicate with a soul. That they
might more effectually form the entire cabildo from their own faction,
and to suit themselves, his illustrious Lordship posted edicts
regarding the two canonries, the doctoral and the magistral, saying
that his Majesty commands that these prebends shall be given by
competition in this cathedral, as in the others. Those who competed for
them were the Japanese Naito, the little Visayan Caraballo, the mulatto
Rocha, and Altamirano; and although Doctor Don Jose de Atienza entered
the competition, and gave his competitive discourse in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>public, and
preached on short notice to the admiration of his hearers, no one in
the city doubts that he will not succeed in obtaining anything, as he
is not of their faction and was graduated by the Society. He felt so
certain of this that he said so in his sermon. For they will strive to
form the entire cabildo of their own men and from their following, so
that, even if the archbishop dies, the Dominican fathers will not cease
to rule, which is the object at which they aim. Thus far the canonries
have not been conferred; it seems that they are waiting until the ship
shall sail, so that they may send word [to Espa&ntilde;a that the
matter remains] in doubt; but no one has any doubt that two will surely
enter upon these prebends, and that Atienza has no chance at all. That
clique are proceeding, in regard to everything, in a reckless and very
insolent manner, and without any caution, for there is no one who can
resist them; and therefore they have rendered themselves formidable in
this country, and the arbitrators of all matters. It is hoped that the
storm will not be so severe now, with the entrance of the royal
Audiencia upon the government&mdash;on account of the very unexpected
and sudden death of the governor, Don Gabriel de Curuzelaegui, the
abettor of all these doings. This occurred in the month of April last,
and was caused by a retention of urine, which ended his life in three
days. At that time, governor, archbishop, investigating judge, and
Dominicans were preparing a farrago of documents to mislead the Council
and to further their own reckless proceedings; they even notified the
ex-governor, Don Juan de Vargas, that he must go into exile to
Pangasinan, to which place he had banished the archbishop. He made an
urgent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294">294</a>]</span>plea for his absolution, in view of his
Majesty&rsquo;s decree which ordered the archbishop to absolve him, but
the latter would not listen to it. On the day when they carried him
into exile, he entered the house of the archbishop, and, ascending the
stairs on his knees until he reached the prelate&rsquo;s feet, Don Juan
begged him, with tears in his eyes, to absolve him; but the archbishop,
with a heart like a tiger&rsquo;s, refused to hear him, and answered
him only with harsh words. He told Don Juan that he must submit to the
penance imposed, which required him to wear the sackcloth robe, the
halter round his neck, the yellow breeches, etc., going through the
churches, as he had been commanded to do; and that, if he did not
consent to this, he must go to Lingayen without absolution. Thence he
repaired to the royal Audiencia, who issued a royal decree to the
archbishop that he must absolve Don Juan; but immediately the governor
and archbishop joined hands to avert this pressure, and drew up an
iniquitous accusation against the auditors, containing many falsehoods
and charges. Among other things, they brought forward evidence that the
auditors had illicit relations with Do&ntilde;a Isabel, the wife of Don
Juan de Vargas, and this by several witnesses. It may be imagined what
sort of a country this is, and how much credit is due to the
accusations that are made here&mdash;and to the witnesses in Manila,
who swear to anything that suits a governor. This done, the archbishop
replied to the royal decree by challenging the auditors, for the causes
which he proved against them. This answer was made a very short time
before the governor&rsquo;s death; it was sent to him sealed, and
afterward was found with the above accusation&mdash;which as some
declared, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295">295</a>]</span>was for the purpose of ruining this Audiencia
as he had destroyed the other.</p>

<p>In this condition are affairs at present. Father Fray Raimundo
Verart, the instigator of so many disturbances, is going there
[<i>i.e.</i>, to Espa&ntilde;a], summoned by his Majesty. May it please
God that now the misfortunes of this unhappy land may cease.</p>
</div>

<div class="div2">
<h3 class="normal">Information from Filipinas and Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a</h3>

<p>With the arrival of the galleon from Filipinas in this Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a has been unladen a raft [<i lang="es">flota</i>] of news,
which other pens, less awkward than mine, will relate; I can only tell
what I have known. In the year 1687 the examiner [<i lang=
"es">pesquisidor</i>]&mdash;as the Chinese say, the fisherman [<i lang=
"es">pescador</i>]&mdash;Don Francisco Campos y Valdivia arrived at
Manila; according to the reports, it would seem that he went there to
encourage anew and continue the malignant acts of the archbishop and
the Dominicans, and to pillage the wealth of that community and finally
squeeze out of it the little blood that it has. He immediately joined
hands with Governor Curuzealegui, the archbishop, and the Dominicans;
he selected as his adviser, director, and counselor the Dominican Fray
Raimundo Verart, the source of so many disturbances; and&mdash;without
heeding that his Majesty, on account of the latter&rsquo;s turbulent
disposition, had commanded that the said religious should proceed to
the court [at Madrid]&mdash;he immediately took possession of the said
religious, who was with him at all hours of day and night, in his
house. [He did so] in order that the religious should prepare for him
the documents, acts, and inquiries for which he was commissioned, on
account of the illiterate manner in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>the fisherman usually drew them
up. From this may be interred what documents he will carry to the
court, with a hand so malicious and bold&mdash;but with the safety of
the father confessor&rsquo;s broad shoulders, and the cunning
tendencies of the chief, of vast piety.</p>

<p>There are more than three hundred thousand pesos, in jewels and
commodities, that he has carried away, well guarded; and he is full of
confidence of new rewards. I do not doubt that the chief distributor
will enjoy a very pleasant time, knowing that the Jesuits remain
humbled, trampled down, and without recourse&mdash;they, to whom on so
many grounds he ought to show himself at least indifferent.</p>

<p>He discharged his fury against the governor, Don Juan de Vargas,
and, without allowing him to defend himself&mdash;since hardly had Don
Juan chosen a lawyer or notary when he awoke in exile&mdash;he banished
him to a distant place, and among Dominicans. And, to soften this
humiliation, the archbishop denied him the absolution that he sought
(going up to the prelate&rsquo;s house on his knees), without paying
any attention to the strict injunction of his Majesty, or urging the
visitor to secure its fulfilment; and demanding an order to carry Don
Juan to Mexico, notwithstanding the securities [that he had given] for
his residencia. He was left in the hands of the Dominicans and the
archbishop, in order that the latter might satiate himself more at
leisure with Don Juan&rsquo;s sorrows.</p>

<p>The visitor turned his attention to the auditors, whom he found
already exiled by the governor; and, two of them having died a little
while before, he sent for the auditor Bolivar. It is reported that the
governor, fearing this man, gave orders that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>should put him to
death on the route.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5523src" href=
"#xd0e5523">8</a> What is certain is, that as he finished drinking a
cup of chocolate, he fell dead, and his finger-nails and lips made
known the poison; and it is noted that in the following year, about the
same time, the said governor died very suddenly, and in melancholy
circumstances&mdash;according to rumor and letters, like a beast. The
last of the officials, the fiscal Alanis, the visitor brought with him
to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, after having confiscated all his goods and
inflicted on him a thousand annoyances&mdash;as also the dean, Don
Miguel Ortiz. With him came the Dominican Verart, in order that with
his assistance the visitor might continue the management of his
documents.</p>

<p>About this time began the fury of the archbishop and the Dominicans
against the Society. [The remains of] Auditor Grimaldos having reposed
five years in the sepulcher of the college at Manila, the archbishop
was pricked by scruples on the day of St. Ignatius; and, when the
church was full, and the governor and the Audiencia were expected for
the fiesta, a notary came in, publishing the declaration that the
church was polluted&mdash;that the auditor Grimaldos had died
impenitent, and that everyone should go out of the church, under
penalty of excommunication. The church remained closed until the second
day of October. On that day the provisor went and opened the sepulcher,
and, seeing therein three corpses, among which he could not distinguish
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>the
one that he sought, he proceeded to bless what he called the
&ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; church. The examiner [<i>i.e.</i>, Campos y
Valdivia], playing the r&ocirc;le of a reconciler, obliged the fathers
of the Society to go to attend a feast-day of the Dominicans, and the
latter to be present at another in the Society&rsquo;s house. Afterward
the archbishop arranged the cabildo to suit himself, without accepting
or noticing the prebends who came appointed by his Majesty, and
replaced all of them from his own college of Santo Tomas; and among
these were men most unworthy [of such posts], mestizos who were half
negro. His principal object is, that if he should die the cabildo may
appoint the bishop of Troya as ruler [of the diocese], in order that
the disturbances may not cease; and very strung recommendations are
going for the court, to appoint in that church the said bishop of
Troya, in order that he may more vigorously continue the disputes and
lawsuits, which do not cease. Meanwhile, at court let not efforts cease
to persuade that this religious order is not suited for sees [<i lang=
"es">mitras</i>] so remote&mdash;as the father confessor sets forth,
and that boldly. In every Dominican there is a bishop, a governor, and
an absolute monarch; nor will he acknowledge himself to be a
vassal&mdash;as is shown by a fiscal reply that comes from Filipinas
and will go to the court, in the terms of which is recognized the
intention of that prelate [<i>i.e.</i>, Barrientos].</p>

<p>In the course of the investigation the visitor did not spare the
[belongings required by] decency for the governor&rsquo;s wife,
Do&ntilde;a Isabel de Ardila, taking away from her at public auction
even the bed and the jewels that she used, and from her husband even
the sword that he carried at his belt. The annoyances <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>inflicted upon
the citizens are innumerable; and in order that the jewels and other
valuables which he obtained from the seizures of goods should not be
sold at a low price, at auctions, he caused them to be knocked down to
himself, but in the names of other persons, and he is becoming,
therefore, enormously wealthy.</p>

<p>Nor was the archbishop idle at this time. He proceeded to give rules
to the new Audiencia as to the manner in which it was to conduct
itself, declaring that recourse to it in cases of fuerza and banishment
was faulty; and a little later, when urged to absolve Governor Vargas,
he replied that he challenged the new auditors for cause, since he
considered them all to be in love with the governor&rsquo;s wife.
Consequently, it would be necessary that another Audiencia should come,
or that, to check lawsuits, they delegate the authority to
him&mdash;which they refused, since the ecclesiastics are vassals.</p>

<p>In this so tangled web of mischiefs occasioned by his cause, died
very suddenly Governor Don Gabriel de Curuzaelegui; so many pecuniary
obligations of his were made public that they seem incredible, even to
those who do not know the opportunities for profit of that governmental
post. He left the administration of his estate to the man who had been
the mainstay of his government, Don Tomas de Andaya&mdash;a native of
Andaya in France,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5547src" href=
"#xd0e5547">9</a> however much he has tried to persuade people that he
was born in Viscaya.</p>

<p>On December 19, 1689, the ship &ldquo;Santo Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>cast anchor
in Acapulco, and in it came the dean of Manila, Don Miguel Ortiz de
Cobarrubias; the fiscal, Don Lorenzo de Alanis; the Dominican father
Fray Raimundo Verart; and the examiner, Don Francisco Campos y
Valdivia. The last-named was detained in the said port, continuing some
investigations with which he was charged&mdash;especially that
concerning the registration [of the galleon&rsquo;s cargo] for the year
1684; and in regard to the seizure in the same year of the property of
Governor Don Juan de Vargas, in which he supposed there had been some
formal act of the royal officials, with information from the viceroy,
Marques de la Laguna&mdash;investigations all upon uncertain matters,
little praised by his subordinates, or acceptable to them. On occasion
of receiving a declaration, the examiner compelled General Antonio de
Aztina to surrender his authority, at the same time appointing, <i
lang="la">de plenitudine potestatis</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;in the
fulness of his power&rdquo;], as commander Captain Oriosola&mdash;who
enjoyed this new favor no long time; for the viceroy, Conde de Galvez,
being informed of this, immediately gave the appointment of commander
to Don Juan de Garaicochea.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of January, 1690, his investigations being
concluded, the examiner left Acapulco, and sent ahead by the fast
carriers as many as twenty loads of his own equipage, with a servant,
and verbal orders that the guards should give them free passage.
Information of this exemption reached the custom-house of this city,
and its special judge, Don Juan Jose de Ciga y Linage, stationed
officers on the route for safety. The examiner set out, by easy stages,
because he was conveying a woman who had lately become <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>a
mother&mdash;one of his two maidservants, with whom he traveled, whom
he had secretly married while in the bay, a little before landing at
Vera Cruz; and the said lady died, a few days after leaving Acapulco,
and was buried in the town of Cuernavaca. The said freight and equipage
arrived at Mexico, and, notwithstanding the orders of the examiner, the
following articles were unloaded in the custom-house: twenty-one
chests, four boxes, two escritoires, three boxes, one screen, four
china jars [<i lang="es">tibores</i>],<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e5567src" href="#xd0e5567">10</a> one trunk of clothes, and four
civet-cats. Permission was given that the animals be sent to the house
of Don Geronimo de Chacon, to whom the above goods came directed; but
the rest was kept [at the custom-house], the packages being opened, and
a list of the goods being made. The said examiner being asked for a
load that had gone astray on the journey, he replied, desiring to
shield himself and another person, that it did not belong to him, and
he knew nothing about it. The cause of this search was, it seems, that
secret warning had been given [to the customs officers] of perfumes,
fine stuffs, and other goods improper for [the possession of] an
examiner.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of February, 1690, after various protests and
threatening statements that the said boxes contained only his clothing,
and especially that three contained only the private papers and
documents of his visitation and commission, as he resisted surrendering
the keys the locks were broken of the said three boxes; and in them was
found not one paper. The contents of these, as in the boxes above <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>mentioned,
were as follows: three ornamental boxes and two writing-desks of
lacquered wood, perfume-caskets, trays, combs, fans, porcelain cups,
and curious articles of japanned ware. Besides these, there were forty
cases of fans; <i>item</i>, eighty-six bundles of untwisted silk, and
several libras more of spun silk; <i>item</i>, two hundred and
seventy-five pieces of stuffs&mdash;satin, lampotes, ribbed silk,
Chinese silk, velvets, and other wares from Canton; <i>item</i>, one
hundred and fifty-eight onzas of musk; <i>item</i>, three hundred and
forty-four pairs of silk hose.</p>

<p>They are sure that he is bringing many more packets in the names of
Commander Aztina and Captain Oriosola, the source of these being the
fines&mdash;which, they say, he regulated more by the wealth than by
the faults of the citizens of Manila, levying the fines in merchandise
at low prices, by a third hand, that of the said commander. It is
currently reported that the bales which he is bringing on his own
account, under the names of other persons, exceed one hundred and fifty
in number. It is certain that in the custom-house were opened two lots
of goods [shipped] in the name of the said commander&mdash;one of forty
bales of various commodities, and another of thirty bales of Canton
silk stuffs, both without invoices; also packets, which show little
care and arrangement. This almost entirely confirms the suspicions
entertained, all the more as it is well known that the said commander
has no wealth, and even hardly enough to eat. But as the merchants of
China are here&mdash;who have come, like many of the citizens of
Mejico, frightened by the extortions imposed in Manila&mdash;it is
difficult to declare the [contents of the] said packets while the
examiner remains in these kingdoms.</p>
